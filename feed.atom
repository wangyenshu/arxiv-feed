Abstract: We consider digit systems $(A,\mathcal{D})$, where $ A \in \mathbb{Q}^{n\times n}$ is an expanding matrix and the digit set $\mathcal{D}$ is a suitable subset of $\mathbb{Q}^n$. To such a system, we associate a self-affine set $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}(A,\mathcal{D})$ that lives in a certain representation space $\mathbb{K}$. If $A$ is an integer matrix, then $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}^n$, while in the general rational case $\mathbb{K}$ contains an additional solenoidal factor. We give a criterion for $\mathcal{F}$ to have positive Haar measure, i.e., for being a rational self-affine tile. We study topological properties of $\mathcal{F}$ and prove some tiling theorems. Our setting is very general in the sense that we allow $(A,\mathcal{D})$ to be a nonstandard digit system. A standard digit system $(A,\mathcal{D})$ is one in which we require $\mathcal{D}$ to be a complete system of residue class representatives w.r.t. a certain naturally chosen residue class ring. Our tools comprise the Frobenius normal form and character theory of locally compact abelian groups.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper we study the modular differential equation $y''+s\,E_4\, y=0$ where $E_4$ is the weight 4 Eisenstein series and $s=\pi^2r^2$ with $r=n/m$ being a rational number in reduced form such that $m\geq 7$. This study is carried out by solving the associated Schwarzian equation $\{h,\tau\}=2\,s\,E_4$ and using the theory of equivariant functions on the upper half-plane and the 2-dimensional vector-valued modular forms. The solutions are expressed in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric series. This completes the study of the above-mentioned modular differential equation of the associated Schwarzian equation given that the cases $1\leq m\leq 6$ have already been treated in the litterature.]]></summary>

Abstract: The notion of formal Siegel modular forms for an arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma$ of the symplectic group of genus $n$ is a generalization of symmetric formal Fourier-Jacobi series. Assuming an upper bound on the affine covering number of the Siegel modular variety associated with $\Gamma$, we prove that all formal Siegel modular forms are given by Fourier-Jacobi expansions of classical holomorphic Siegel modular forms. We also show that the required upper bound is always met if $2\leq n \leq 4$. As an application we consider the case of the paramodular group of squarefree level and genus $2$.]]></summary>

Abstract: In his second notebook, Ramanujan discovered the following identity for the special values of $\zeta(s)$ at the odd positive integers \begin{equation*}\begin{aligned}\alpha^{-m}\,\left\{\dfrac{1}{2}\,\zeta(2m + 1) + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\dfrac{n^{-2m - 1}}{e^{2\alpha n} - 1}\right\} &-(- \beta)^{-m}\,\left\{\dfrac{1}{2}\,\zeta(2m + 1) + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\dfrac{n^{-2m - 1}}{e^{2\beta n} - 1}\right\}\nonumber &=2^{2m}\sum_{k = 0}^{m + 1}\dfrac{\left(-1\right)^{k-1}B_{2k}\,B_{2m - 2k+2}}{\left(2k\right)!\left(2m -2k+2\right)!}\,\alpha^{m - k + 1}\beta^k \label{(1.2)},\end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ are positive numbers such that $ \alpha\beta = \pi^2 $ and $ m $ is a positive integer. As shown by Berndt in the viewpoint of general transformation of analytic Eisenstein series, it is a natural companion of Euler's famous formula for even zeta values. In this note, we prove an analogue of the above Ramanujan's identity in the functions fields setting, which involves the Bernoulli-Carlitz numbers.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $p\neq{2,3}$ be a prime number and let $\Gamma \subset \mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ be a congruence subgroup with modular curve $X_{\Gamma}/K$ and Jacobian $J(X_{\Gamma})$. In this paper we give an explicit group-theoretic description of the semistable toric rank and component group of $J(X_{\Gamma})$ at the finite places of $K$ lying over $p$. We first produce a suitable deformation retract of the minimal Berkovich skeleton of $X_{\Gamma}$ in terms of Hecke-Iwahori double coset spaces. We call this deformation retract the pruned skeleton of the curve. Our description of this skeleton includes a group-theoretic formula for the edge lengths, allowing us to give the component group of the modular curve as the quotient of a lattice using the monodromy pairing. For $X_{0}(N)$, $X_{1}(N)$, $X_{sp}(N)$ and $X_{sp}^{+}(N)$, we explicitly determine the pruned skeleta using a set of coset schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$. This in particular recovers results by Deligne-Rapoport, Edixhoven, Coleman-McMurdy and Tsushima on the semistable reduction type of $X_{0}(p^{n})$ for $n\leq{4}$. Finally, we determine the geometric Tamagawa number and the prime-to-$2$ structure of the component group of $X_{0}(N)$ over the extension given by Krir's theorem.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove asymptotic formulae for small weighted solutions of quadratic congruences of the form $\lambda_1x_1^2+\cdots +\lambda_nx_n^2\equiv \lambda_{n+1}\bmod{p^m}$, where $p$ is a fixed odd prime, $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_{n+1}$ are integer coefficients such that $(\lambda_1\cdots \lambda _{n},p)=1$ and $m\rightarrow \infty$. If $n\ge 6$, $p\ge 5$ and the coefficients are fixed and satisfy $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n>0$ and $(\lambda_{n+1},p)=1$ (inhomogeneous case), we obtain an asymptotic formula which is valid for integral solutions $(x_1,...,x_n)$ in cubes of side length at least $p^{(1/2+\varepsilon)m}$, centered at the origin. If $n\ge 4$ and $\lambda_{n+1}=0$ (homogeneous case), we prove a result of the same strength for coefficients $\lambda_i$ which are allowed to vary with $m$. These results extend previous results of the first- and the third-named authors and N. Bag.]]></summary>

Abstract: Pila and Tsimerman proved in 2017 that for every $k$ there exists at most finitely many $k$-tuples $(x_1,\ldots, x_k)$ of distinct non-zero singular moduli with the property "$x_1, \ldots,x_k$ are multiplicatively dependent, but any proper subset of them is multiplicatively independent". The proof was non-effective, using Siegel's lower bound for the Class Number. In 2019 Riffaut obtained an effective version of this result for $k=2$. Moreover, he determined all the instances of $x^my^n\in \mathbb Q^\times$, where $x,y$ are distinct singular moduli and $m,n$ non-zero integers. In this article we obtain a similar result for $k=3$. We show that $x^my^nz^r\in \mathbb Q^\times$ (where $x,y,z$ are distinct singular moduli and $m,n,r$ non-zero integers) implies that the discriminants of $x,y,z$ do not exceed $10^{10}$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Bidirected graphs are multigraphs where every edge has an independent direction at each end. In the paper, with an arbitrary bidirected graph we associate a non-negative integral quadratic form (called the incidence form of the graph), and determine all forms that appear in this way in two main results: first, among non-negative connected unit forms, precisely those of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$ or $\mathbb{D}$ are incidence forms; second, we give simple conditions on the coefficients of a non-negative connected non-unitary form to be an incidence form. We say that those non-unitary forms have Dynkin type $\mathbb{C}$, and justify such nomenclature by generalizing known classifications and properties of non-negative quadratic forms of Dynkin types $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{D}$ to the introduced type~$\mathbb{C}$. We also show that the graphical framework of an incidence form is an useful tool to visualize its arithmetical properties, to prove new facts and to perform efficient computations for integral quadratic forms and related problems in number theory, algebra and graph theory. For instance, in a third main result we relate the walks of a bidirected graph with the $0,1,2$-roots of the associated incidence form (and to the classical root systems in the positive case). Moreover, we prove the universality property for a large class of integral quadratic forms, provide computational methods to find solutions or to characterize the finiteness of the sets of solutions of various related Diophantine equations, show a variant of Whitney's theorem on line graphs using switching classes, and apply our techniques to give a conceptual and constructive proof of the non-negativity (and possible Dynkin types) of the Euler quadratic forms of a class of finite-dimensional gentle algebras.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $C$ and $D$ be smooth, proper and geometrically integral curves over a finite field $F$. Any morphism from $D$ to $C$ induces a morphism of their \'etale fundamental groups. The anabelian philosophy proposed by Grothendieck suggests that, when $C$ has genus at least $2$, all open homomorphisms between the \'etale fundamental groups should arise in this way from a nonconstant morphism of curves. We relate this expectation to the arithmetic of the curve $C_K$ over the global function field $K = F(D)$. Specifically, we show that there is a bijection between the set of conjugacy classes of well-behaved morphism of fundamental groups and locally constant adelic points of $C_K$ that survive \'etale descent. We use this to provide further evidence for the anabelian conjecture by relating it to another recent conjecture by Sutherland and the second author.]]></summary>

The results require a refined application of the multi-Frey technique, which we show to be effective in new ways to reduce the bounds on the exponents $n$.
  We also give a number of results for the equations $x^5 + y^5 = d z^n$, where $d = 1, 2$, under additional local conditions on the solutions. This includes a result which is reminiscent of the second case of Fermat's Last Theorem, and which uses a new application of level raising at $p$ modulo $p$.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that if $(U_n)_{n\ge 1}$ is any nondegenerate linearly recurrent sequence of integers whose general term is up to sign not a polynomial in $n$, then the inequality $\phi(|U_n|)\ge |U_{\phi(n)}|$ holds on a set of positive integers $n$ of density $1$, where $\phi$ is the Euler function. In fact, we show that the set of $n\le x$ for which the above inequality fails has counting function $O_U(x/\log x)$.]]></summary>

In particular, we classify even order algebraically trivial non symplectic automorphisms, with or without trivial discriminant action. In the case of nontrivial discriminant actions, we show that such automorphisms exist only for finitely many known deformation types and orders.]]></summary>

Abstract: Up to isomorphism, there is a unique connected semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$ of Lie type $\mathrm{F}_{4}$, with compact real points and split over $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ for all primes $p$. Let $\mathbf{F}_{4}$ be such a group. In this paper, we study the level one automorphic representations of $\mathbf{F}_{4}$ in the spirit of the work of Chenevier, Renard, and Ta\"ibi. First, we give an explicit formula for the number of these representations having any given archimedean component. For this, we study the automorphism group of the two definite exceptional Jordan algebras of rank $27$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ studied by Gross, as well as the dimension of the invariants of these groups in all irreducible representations of $\mathbf{F}_{4}(\mathbb{R})$. Then, assuming standard conjectures by Arthur and Langlands for $\mathbf{F}_{4}$, we refine this counting by studying the contribution of the representations whose global Arthur parameter has any possible image (or "Sato-Tate group"). This includes a detailed description of all those images, as well as precise statements for the Arthur's multiplicity formula in each case. As a consequence, we obtain a conjectural but explicit formula for the number of algebraic, cuspidal, level one automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}_{26}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with Sato-Tate group $\mathbf{F}_{4}(\mathbb{R})$ of any given weight (assumed "$\mathrm{F}_{4}$-regular"). The first example of such representations occurs in motivic weight $36$.]]></summary>

Abstract: In his work on defining the pointed set B(G) for all local and global fields, Kottwitz introduced certain Galois gerbes and considered their 'algebraic' cohomology with values in algebraic groups. However, the gerbes so constructed are only canonical up to conjugation by their bands. This is enough in order to ensure that the cohomology set B(G) is canonical, but not enough data to pin down the set of algebraic cocycles used to compute the set B(G). For arithmetic applications it is often desirable to have the finer control provided by these cocycles readily at hand. To this end we propose in this paper a framework with which to work with such spaces of algebraic Kottwitz cocycles. This will play a crucial role in our forthcoming work on the formalism of Shimura varieties.]]></summary>

Abstract: We present an algorithm that, for every fixed degree $n\ge 3$, will enumerate all degree-$n$ places of the projective line over a finite field $k$ up to the natural action of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ using $O(\log q)$ space and $\widetilde{O}(q^{n-3})$ time, where $q=\#k$. Since there are $\Theta(q^{n-3})$orbits of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ acting on the set of degree-$n$ places, the algorithm is quasilinear in the size of its output. The algorithm is probabilistic unless we assume the extended Riemann hypothesis, because its complexity depends on that of polynomial factorization: for odd $n$, it involves factoring $\Theta(q^{n-3})$ polynomials over $k$ of degree up to ${1 + ((n-1)/2)^n}$.
  For composite degrees $n$, earlier work of the author gives an algorithm for enumerating $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ orbit representatives for degree-$n$ places of $\mathbf{P}^1$ over $k$ that runs in time $\widetilde{O}(q^{n-3})$ independent of the extended Riemann hypothesis, but that uses $O(q^{n-3})$ space.
  We also present an algorithm for enumerating orbit representatives for the action of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(k)$ on the degree-$n$ effective divisors of $\mathbf{P}^1$ over finite fields $k$. The two algorithms depend on one another; our method of enumerating orbits of places of odd degree $n$ depends on enumerating orbits of effective divisors of degree $(n+1)/2$.]]></summary>

Abstract: In arXiv:2406.0243 two real functions $g(x,t)$ and $f(x,t)$ are defined, so that the Riemann-Siegel $Z$ function is given as \[Z(t)=\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\Bigl\{\frac{u(t)e^{\frac{\pi i}{8}}}{\frac12+it}\int_0^\infty g(x,t)e^{i f(x,t)}\,dt\Bigr\},\] where $u(t)$ is a real function of order $t^{-1/4}$ when $t\to+\infty$. The function $g(x,t)$ is indefinitely differentiable and tends to $0$ as well as all its derivatives when $x\to0^+$ or $x\to+\infty$. Since, furthermore, for $t\to+\infty$ the function $f(x,t)$ tends to $+\infty$ we may expect that the integral depends essentially on the behavior of $g(x,t)$ at the extremes.
  As Polya in an analogous situation we consider the substitution of $\psi(x)$ by a simpler similar function. A simple function with this behavior is \[\psi_0(x):=2\pi(1+\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-5/2})e^{-\pi x-\frac{\pi}{4x}}.\] Therefore, we define $J_0(t)$ replacing in the definition of $J(t)$ the function $\psi(x)$ by the simpler $\psi_0(x)$. \begin{equation} J_0(t)=2\pi\int_0^\infty (1+\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-\frac52})e^{-\pi x-\frac{\pi}{4x}}(1-ix)^{\frac12(\frac12+it)}\,dx. \end{equation} The resulting $Z_0(t)$ disappoints us \[Z_0(t)\asymp \mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\Bigl\{\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\exp\Bigl\{i\Bigl(\frac{t}{2}\log\frac{t}{2\pi}-\frac{t}{2}-\frac{\pi}{8}\Bigr)\Bigr\}+\frac{2}{(2\pi t)^{1/4}}\exp\Bigl(\pi i\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\;\Bigr)\Bigr\},\quad t\to+\infty.\] However, the integral $J_0(t)$ is interesting as a technical challenge. And still we have the possibility to get a better result improving $\psi_0(x)$.
  This is a preliminary version, and we set it as a challenge: to compute and study this integral.]]></summary>

Abstract: Counterparts of several classical results of number theory are proven for the ring of polynomials with coefficients in a number field. A theorem of Milnor that determines the Witt ring of a function field is applied to prove an analogue of Gauss's principal genus theorem for binary quadratic forms with polynomial coefficients. This is used to help understand when and why quadratic reciprocity fails in these polynomial rings. Another application is a count of the number of cyclic subgroups whose order is divisible by four in the primary decomposition of the torsion subgroup of the Jacobian of certain hyperelliptic curves. Invariant theory is applied to prove an analogue of a classical theorem of Fueter to give criteria for an elliptic curve with a polynomial discriminant and zero $j$-invariant to have no affine points over the associated function field.]]></summary>

Abstract: Recently, Ono and the third author discovered that the reciprocals of the theta series $(q;q)_\infty^3$ and $(q^2;q^2)_\infty(q;q^2)_\infty^2$ have infinitely many closed formulas in terms of MacMahon's quasimodular forms $A_k(q)$ and $C_k(q)$. In this article, we use the well-known infinite product identities due to Jacobi, Watson, and Hirschhorn to derive further such closed formulas for reciprocals of other interesting infinite products. Moreover, with these formulas, we approximate these reciprocals to arbitrary order simply using MacMahon's functions and {\it MacMahon type} functions. For example, let $\Theta_{6}(q):=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \chi_6(n) n q^{\frac{n^2-1}{24}}$ be the theta function corresponding to the odd quadratic character modulo $6$. Then for any positive integer $n$, we have $$\frac{1}{\Theta_{6}(q)}= q^{-\frac{3n^2+n}{2}}\sum_{\substack{k=r_1\\ k\equiv n\hspace{-0.2cm}\pmod{2}}}^{r_2}(-1)^{\frac{n-k}{2}}A_{k}(q)C_{\frac{3n-k}{2}}(q)+O(q^{n+1}),$$ where $r_1:=\lfloor\frac{3n-1-\sqrt{12n+13}}{3}\rfloor+1$ and $r_2:=\lceil\frac{3n-1+\sqrt{12n+13}}{3}\rceil-1$.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove the inhomogeneous generalization of the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture in dimension $m \geq 3$. That is, given $\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $\psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that $\sum (\varphi(q)\psi(q)/q)^m = \infty$, we show that for almost every $\mathbf{x} \in\mathbb{R}^m$ there are infinitely many rational vectors $\mathbf{a}/q$ such that $\vert q\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{y}\vert<\psi(q)$ and such that each component of $\mathbf{a}$ is coprime to $q$. This is an inhomogeneous extension of a homogeneous conjecture of Sprind\v{z}uk which was itself proved in 1990 by Pollington and Vaughan. In fact, our main result generalizes Pollington-Vaughan not only to the inhomogeneous case, but also to the setting of moving targets, where the inhomogeneous parameter $\mathbf{y}$ is free to vary with $q$. In contrast, we show by an explicit construction that the (1-dimensional) inhomogeneous Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture fails to hold with a moving target, implying that any successful attack on the one-dimensional problem must use the fact that the inhomogeneous parameter is constant. We also introduce new questions regarding moving targets.]]></summary>

A conjecture of Venkatesh describes the structure of the contribution of $\Pi$ to the homology of the locally symmetric spaces associated to $\mathbf{G}$. We investigate this conjecture in the setting of $p$-adic homology with $p$ a totally split prime. Along the way, we elaborate on the relations between Venkatesh's conjecture and completed homology, the Taylor-Wiles method and the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence. Our main result is a `big $R=T$' theorem in characteristic 0, from which we deduce a variant of the $p$-adic realisation of Venkatesh's conjecture, conditional on various natural conjectures and technical assumptions.]]></summary>

Abstract: We determine the Brauer group of the Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$, the moduli space of elliptic curves with a marked $2$-torsion subgroup over bases of arithmetic interest. Antieau and Meier determine the Brauer group for $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$, the moduli stack of elliptic curves by exploiting the fact it is covered by the Legendre family and using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Over an algebraically closed field, Shin uses the coarse space map to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$. We combine techniques from both papers to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $x \ge 2$, let $N_x$ be an integer chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathbb Z \cap [1, x]$, and let $(V_1, V_2, \ldots)$ be a Poisson--Dirichlet process of parameter $1$. We prove that there exists a coupling of these two random objects such that $$ \mathbb E \, \sum_{i \ge 1} |\log P_i- V_i\log x| \ll 1, $$ where the implied constant is absolute and $N_x = P_1P_2 \cdots$ is the unique factorization of $N_x$ into primes or ones with the $P_i$'s being non-increasing. This establishes a conjecture of Arratia (2002) arXiv:1305.0941 who proved that the left-hand side in the above estimate can be made $\ll \log\!\log x$. We also use this coupling to give a probabilistic proof of the Dirichlet law for the average distribution of the integer factorization into $k$ parts proved in 2023 by Leung arXiv:2206.14728 and we improve on its error term.]]></summary>

Abstract: We study the irreducibility and Galois group of random polynomials over function fields. We prove that a random polynomial $f=y^n+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i(x)y^i\in\mathbb F_q[x][y]$ with i.i.d coefficients $a_i$ taking values in the set $\{a(x)\in\mathbb{F}_q[x]: \mathrm{deg}\, a\leq d\}$ with uniform probability, is irreducible with probability tending to $1-\frac{1}{q^d}$ as $n\to\infty$, where $d$ and $q$ are fixed. We also prove that with the same probability, the Galois group of this random polynomial contains the alternating group $A_n$. Moreover, we prove that if we assume a version of the polynomial Chowla conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$, then the Galois group of this polynomial is actually equal to the symmetric group $S_n$ with probability tending to $1-\frac{1}{q^d}$. We also study the other possible Galois groups occurring with positive limit probability. Finally, we study the same problems with $n$ fixed and $d\to\infty$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.]]></summary>

Abstract: The mod-2 arithmetic Milnor invariants, introduced by Morishita, provide a decomposition law for primes in canonical Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ with unitriangular Galois groups, and contain the Legendre and Redei symbols as special cases. Morishita further proposed a notion of mod-q arithmetic Milnor invariants, where q is a prime power, for number fields containing the q-th roots of unity and satisfying certain class field theory assumptions. We extend this theory from the number field context to general fields, by introducing a notion of a linking invariant for discrete valuations and orderings. We further express it as a Magnus homomorphism coefficient, and relate it to Massey product elements in Galois cohomology.]]></summary>

In the converse direction, given $\epsilon>0$, we construct tilings whose minimal period has the same prime factors as $|A|$ and is bounded from below by $D^{3/2-\epsilon}$.

  In order to carry out this investigation of randomness for fields, we develop computability in the context of infinite Galois theory (where the relevant Galois groups are uncountable), including definitions of computable and computably enumerable Galois groups and computability of Haar measure on the Galois groups.]]></summary>

Abstract: Using the special value at $u=1$ of Artin-Ihara $L$-functions, we associate to every $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of a finite connected graph a polynomial which we call the \emph{Ihara polynomial}. We show that the number of spanning trees for the finite intermediate graphs of such a cover can be expressed in terms of the Pierce-Lehmer sequence associated to a factor of the Ihara polynomial. This allows us to express the asymptotic growth of the number of spanning trees in terms of the Mahler measure of this polynomial. Specializing to the situation where the base graph is a bouquet or the dumbbell graph gives us back previous results in the literature for circulant and $I$-graphs (including the generalized Petersen graphs). We also express the $p$-adic valuation of the number of spanning trees of the finite intermediate graphs in terms of the $p$-adic Mahler measure of the Ihara polynomial. When applied to a particular $\mathbb{Z}$-cover, our result gives us back Lengyel's calculation of the $p$-adic valuations of Fibonacci numbers.]]></summary>

Abstract: We investigate Selmer groups of Jacobians of curves that admit an action of a non-trivial group of automorphisms, and give applications to the study of the parity of Selmer ranks. Under the Shafarevich--Tate conjecture, we give an expression for the parity of the Mordell--Weil rank of an arbitrary Jacobian in terms of purely local invariants; the latter can be seen as an arithmetic analogue of local root numbers, which, under the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, similarly control parities of ranks of abelian varieties. As an application, we give a new proof of the parity conjecture for elliptic curves. The core of the paper is devoted to developing the arithmetic theory of Jacobians for Galois covers of curves, including decomposition of their L-functions, and the interplay between Brauer relations and Selmer groups.]]></summary>

Abstract: We investigate subsets with small sumset in arbitrary abelian groups. For an abelian group $G$ and an $n$-element subset $Y \subseteq G$ we show that if $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, then the number of subsets $A \subseteq Y$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$ is at most \[2^{o(s)}\binom{\frac{m+\beta}{2}}{s},\] where $\beta$ is the size of the largest subgroup of $G$ of size at most $\left(1+o(1)\right)m$. This bound is sharp for $\mathbb{Z}$ and many other groups. Our result improves the one of Campos and nearly bridges the remaining gap in a conjecture of Alon, Balogh, Morris, and Samotij.
  We also explore the behaviour of uniformly chosen random sets $A \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$. Under the same assumption that $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, we show that with high probability there exists an arithmetic progression $P \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ of size at most $m/2 + o(m)$ containing all but $o(s)$ elements of $A$. Analogous results are obtained for asymmetric sumsets, improving results by Campos, Coulson, Serra, and W\"otzel. The main tool behind our proofs is a graph container theorem combined with a variant of an asymmetric hypergraph container theorem.]]></summary>

We deduce closed-form expressions for traces of Hecke operators corresponding to primes of degree 1 and provide algorithms for primes of higher degree. We improve the Ramanujan bound and deduce the decomposition of cusp forms of level $\Gamma_0(T)$ into oldforms and newforms, as conjectured by Bandini-Valentino, under the hypothesis that each Hecke eigenvalue has multiplicity less than $p$.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a Lefschetz trace formula for B\"ockle-Pink crystals on tame Deligne-Mumford stacks of finite type over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and apply it to the crystal associated to the universal Drinfeld module. Combined with the Eichler-Shimura theory developed by B\"ockle, this leads to a trace formula for Hecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms. As a corollary, we deduce a Ramanujan bound on the traces of Hecke operators.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $C$ and $W$ be two sets of integers. If $C+W=\mathbb{Z}$, then $C$ is called an additive complement to $W$. We further call $C$ a minimal additive complement to $W$ if no proper subset of $C$ is an additive complement to $W$. Answering a problem of Nathanson in part, we give sufficient conditions of $W$ which has no minimal additive complements. Our result also extends the prior result of Chen and Yang.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this work we develop, through a governing field,  genus theory for a number field $\K$ with tame ramification in $T$ and splitting in $S$, where $T$ and $S$ are finite disjoint sets of primes of $\K$. This approach extends that initiated by the second author in the case of the class group. It allows expressing the $S$-$T$ genus number of a cyclic extension $\L/\K$ of degree $p$ in terms of the rank of a matrix constructed from the Frobenius elements of the primes ramified in $\L/\K$, in the Galois group of the underlying governing extension. For quadratic extensions $\L/\Q$, the matrices in question are constructed from the Legendre symbols between the primes ramified in  $\L/\Q$ and the primes in $S$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Given an imaginary quadratic number field $K$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, we are interested in the asymptotic \emph{distance to nearest neighbour} (or \emph{gap}) statistic of complex Farey fractions $\frac{p}{q}$, with $p,q \in \mathcal{O}_K$ and $0<|q|\leq T$, as $T \to \infty$. Reformulating this problem in a homogeneous dynamical setting, we follow the approach of J. Marklof for real Farey fractions with several variables (2013) and adapt a joint equidistribution result in the real $3$-dimensional hyperbolic space of J. Parkkonen and F. Paulin (2023) to derive the existence of a probability measure describing this asymptotic gap statistic. We obtain an integral formula for the associated cumulative distribution function, and use geometric arguments to find an explicit estimate for its tail distribution in the cases of Gaussian and Eisenstein fractions.]]></summary>

In this paper we generalize the mentioned result and show that Diophantine equations of the form $\alpha\,m_1!\cdots m_r!=f(n!)$ have finitely many integer solutions, too. In addition, we do so by including the case $f$ is the sum of $k$\textsuperscript{th} powers of divisors function.

Abstract: Ramanujan's famous formula for $\zeta(2m+1)$ has captivated the attention of numerous mathematicians over the years. Grosswald, in 1972, found a simple extension of Ramanujan's formula which in turn gives transformation formula for Eisenstein series over the full modular group. Recently, Banerjee, Gupta and Kumar found a number field analogue of Ramanujan's formula. In this paper, we present a new number field analogue of the Ramanujan-Grosswald formula for $\zeta(2m+1)$ by obtaining a formula for Dedekind zeta function at odd arguments. We also obtain a number field analogue of an identity of Chandrasekharan and Narasimhan, which played a crucial role in proving our main identity. As an application, we generalize transformation formula for Eisenstein series $G_{2k}(z)$ and Dedekind eta function $\eta(z)$. A new formula for the class number of a totally real number field is also obtained, which provides a connection with the Kronceker's limit formula for the Dedekind zeta function.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $B$ be a product of finitely many finite fields containing $\mathbb F_q$, $\psi:\mathbb F_q\to \overline{\mathbb Q}_\ell^*$ a nontrivial additive character, and $\chi: B^*\to \overline{\mathbb Q}_\ell^*$ a multiplicative character. Katz introduced the so-called exotic inverted Kloosterman sum \begin{eqnarray*} \mathrm{EIK}(\mathbb F_q, a):=\sum_{\substack{x\in B^* \\ \mathrm{Tr}_{B/\mathbb F_q}(x)\not =0\\ \mathrm{N}_{B/\mathbb F_q}(x)=a}} \chi(x)\psi\Big(\frac{1}{\mathrm{Tr}_{B/\mathbb F_q}(x)}\Big), \ \ a\in \mathbb F_q^*. \end{eqnarray*} We estimate this sum using $\ell$-adic cohomology theory. Our main result is that, up to a trivial term, the associated exotic inverted Kloosterman sheaf is lisse of rank at most $2(n+1)$ and mixed of weight at most $n$, where $n+1 = \dim_{\mathbb F_q}B$. Up to a trivial main term, this gives the expected square root cancellation.]]></summary>

Abstract: Cubic and biquadratic reciprocity have long since been referred to as "the forgotten reciprocity laws", largely since they provide special conditions that are widely considered to be unnecessary in the study of number theory. In this exposition of finite fields and higher reciprocity, we will begin by introducing concepts in abstract algebra and elementary number theory. This will motivate our approach toward understanding the structure and then existence of finite fields, especially with a focus on understanding the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}^{*}$. While surveying finite fields we will provide another proof of quadratic reciprocity. We will proceed to investigate properties of the general multiplicative character, covering the concept of a general Gauss sum as well as basic notions of the Jacobi sum. From there we will begin laying the foundations for the cubic reciprocity law, beginning with a classification of the primes and units of the Eisenstein integers, denoted $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$, and further investigations into the residue class ring $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]/\pi\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ for $\pi$ prime, which is predominantly the world in which cubic reciprocity lies. We then define the general multiplicative character and state the full law of cubic reciprocity. We will finish the section on cubic reciprocity with a brief survey of the cubic residue character of the even prime $2$ and state a significant result due to Gauss that summarizes the conditions for $2$ to be a cubic residue. We conclude with a brief survey of the law of biquadratic reciprocity.]]></summary>

In particular, our $\Omega$-results match the expected conjectural upper bounds when the denominator of the twist is sufficiently small compared to the length of the sum. Non-trivial $\Omega$-results for sums over short segments are also obtained. Along the way we produce lower bounds for mean squares of the exponential sums in question and also improve the best known upper bound for these sums in some ranges of parameters.]]></summary>

The notion of $\mathcal{M}$-points generalizes the concepts of integral points, Campana points and Darmon points. We introduce and study $M$-approximation over number fields and function fields, which is a notion that generalizes weak and strong approximation. We show that this property implies that the set of $\mathcal{M}$-points is not thin. We then give a simple characterisation of when a split toric varieties satisfy $M$-approximation, generalizing work of Nakahara and Streeter. Further, we determine when the set of $\mathcal{M}$-points on a split toric variety is thin.]]></summary>

In the present paper, we focus on negative continued fractions and defined left $q$-deformed negative continued fractions. We give a formula for computing the $q$-deformed Farey sum of the left $q$-deformed rational numbers based on it. We use this formula to give a combinatorial proof of the relationship between the left $q$-deformed rational number and the Jones polynomial of the corresponding rational knot which was proved by Bapat, Becker and Licata using a homological technique. Finally, we combine their work and the $q$-deformed Farey sum, and give a homological interpretation of the $q$-deformed Farey sum. We also give an approach to finding a relationship between real quadratic irrational numbers and homological algebra.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$ endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. In this paper, we show that for any $\epsilon>0$, as $g\to \infty$, for a generic surface in $\mathcal{M}_g$, the error term in the Prime Geodesic Theorem is bounded from above by $g\cdot t^{\frac{3}{4}+\epsilon}$, up to a uniform constant multiplication. The expected value of the error term in the Prime Geodesic Theorem over $\mathcal{M}_g$ is also studied. As an application, we show that as $g\to \infty$, on a generic hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_g$ most closed geodesics of length significantly less than $\sqrt{g}$ are simple and non-separating, and most closed geodesics of length significantly greater than $\sqrt{g}$ are not simple, which confirms a conjecture of Lipnowski-Wright.
  A novel effective upper bound for intersection numbers on $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ is also established, when certain indices are large compared to $\sqrt{g+n}$.]]></summary>

The associated order is denoted as ${\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}:= \{ x\in {\mathbb Q} [G] \, |\, x \cdot \cal{O}_{L_n} \subset {\cal O}_{L_n } \}$, where ${\cal O}_{L_n}$ is the ring of integers of $L_n$. Leopoldt showed that $\cal{O}_{L_n} \simeq {\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}$ as ${\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}$-modules. In this paper, we give a generator of the ${\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}$-module ${\cal O}_{L_n}$ explicitly using the roots of Shanks' cubic polynomial. If $L_n/\mathbb Q$ is tamely ramified, then we have ${\cal A}_{L_n/\mathbb Q}=\mathbb Z [G]$, and the conjugates form a normal integral basis, which has been obtained explicitly in the previous work of Hashimoto and the second author.]]></summary>

Abstract: We study the distribution of consecutive sums of two squares in arithmetic progressions. If $\{E_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the sequence of sums of two squares in increasing order, we show that for any modulus $q$ and any congruence classes $a_1,a_2,a_3 \mod q$ which are admissible in the sense that there are solutions to $x^2 + y^2 \equiv a_i \mod q$, there exist infinitely many $n$ with $E_{n+i-1} \equiv a_i \mod q$, for $i = 1,2,3$. We also show that for any $r_1, r_2 \ge 1$, there exist infinitely many $n$ with $E_{n+i-1} \equiv a_1 \mod q$ for $1 \le i \le r_1$ and $E_{n+ i - 1} \equiv a_2 \mod q$ for $r_1 + 1 \le i \le r_1 + r_2$.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove the existence of the arithmetic degree for dominant rational self-maps at any point whose orbit is generic. As a corollary, we prove the same existence for \'etale morphisms on quasi-projective varieties and any points on it. We apply the proof of this fact to dynamical Lang-Siegel problem. Namely, we prove that local height function associated with zero-dimensional subscheme grows slowly along orbits of a rational map under reasonable assumption. Also if local height function associated with any proper closed subscheme grows fast on a subset of an orbit of a self-morphism, we prove that such subset has Banach density zero under some assumptions.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we initiate the study of the number of rational points with bounded denominators, contained in a non-isotropic $\delta_1\times\ldots\times \delta_R$ neighborhood of a compact submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ of codimension $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^{M}$. We establish an upper bound for this counting function which holds when $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies a strong curvature condition, first introduced by Schindler-Yamagishi in \cite{schindler2022density}. Further, even in the isotropic case when $\delta_1=\ldots=\delta_R=\delta$, we obtain an asymptotic formula which holds beyond the range of distance to $\mathcal{M}$ established in \cite{schindler2022density}. Our result is also a generalization of the work of J.J. Huang \cite{huangduke} for hypersurfaces.
  As an application, we establish for the first time an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of weighted simultaneously well approximable points on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ satisfying the strong curvature condition, which agrees with the lower bound obtained by Allen-Wang in \cite{allen2022note}. Moreover, for $R>1$, we obtain a new upper bound for the number of rational points \textit{on} $\mathcal{M}$, which goes beyond the bound in an analogue of Serre's dimension growth conjecture for submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^M$ .]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $1 \le k \le n,$ and let $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ be integral vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We consider the wedge map $\alpha_{n,k} : (\mathbb{Z}^n)^k /SL_k(\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \wedge^k(\mathbb{Z}^n)$, $(v_1,\ldots,v_k) \rightarrow v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k $. In his Disquisitiones, Gauss proved that $\alpha_{n,2}$ is injective when restricted to a primitive system of vectors when defining his composition law for binary quadratic forms. He also gave an algorithm for inverting $\alpha_{3,2}$ in a different context on the representation of integers by ternary quadratic forms. We give here an explicit algorithm for inverting $\alpha_{n,2}$, and observe via Bhargava's composition law for $\mathbb{Z}^2 \otimes \mathbb{Z}^2 \otimes \mathbb{Z}^2 $ cube that inverting $\alpha_{4,2}$ is the main algorithmic step in Gauss's composition law for binary quadratic forms. This places Gauss's composition as a special case of the geometric problem of inverting a wedge map which may be of independent interests. We also show that a given symmetric positive definite matrix $A$ induces a natural metric on the integral Grassmannian $G_{n,k}(\mathbb{Z})$ so that the map $X \rightarrow X^TAX$ becomes norm preserving.]]></summary>

Abstract: Given $h,g \in \mathbb{N}$, we write a set $X \subset \mathbb{Z}$ to be a $B_{h}^{+}[g]$ set if for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, the number of solutions to the additive equation $n = x_1 + \dots + x_h$ with $x_1, \dots, x_h \in X$ is at most $g$, where we consider two such solutions to be the same if they differ only in the ordering of the summands. We define a multiplicative $B_{h}^{\times}[g]$ set analogously. In this paper, we prove, amongst other results, that there exist absolute constants $g \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\delta>0$ such that for any $h \in \mathbb{N}$ and for any finite set $A$ of integers, the largest $B_{h}^{+}[g]$ set $B$ inside $A$ and the largest $B_{h}^{\times}[g]$ set $C$ inside $A$ satisfy \[ \max \{ |B| , |C| \} \gg_{h} |A|^{(1+ \delta)/h }. \] In fact, when $h=2$, we may set $g = 31$, and when $h$ is sufficiently large, we may set $g = 1$ and $\delta \gg (\log \log h)^{1/2 - o(1)}$. The former makes progress towards a recent conjecture of Klurman--Pohoata and quantitatively strengthens previous work of Shkredov.]]></summary>

Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic method for generating random orthogonal matrices \(A\) that satisfy the property \(A^t S A = S\), where \(S\) is a fixed real invertible symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix. This method is significant as it generalizes the procedures for generating orthogonal matrices that fix a general fixed symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms. The implementation of our algorithms can be accomplished using standard linear algebra libraries.]]></summary>

In this vein, this paper shows that the quantity $2{\bf H}\{X, Y\} - {\bf H}\{X+Y\}$ is a natural entropic analogue of the additive energy $E(A,B)$ between two sets. We develop some basic theory surrounding this quantity, and demonstrate its role in the proof of Tao's entropy variant of the Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers theorem. We examine the regime where entropic additive energy is small, and discuss a family of random variables related to Sidon sets. In finite fields, one can define an entropic multiplicative energy as well, and we formulate sum-product-type conjectures relating these two entropic energies.]]></summary>

They accumulate towards rays generated by wedge products of the K\"ahler class of X and the fundamental class of an orthogonal Shimura subvariety. We also compare C_r(X) with the cone generated by the special cycles of dimension r.

Such plans are specified as a deterministic sequence of actions that are blindly applied without any sensor feedback. Thus, they can be considered as pure exploration in a reinforcement learning context, and we show that with basic memory requirements, they even yield asymptotically optimal plans. Building upon results in number theory and theory of automata, we provide universal plans both for discrete and continuous (motion) planning and prove their (semi)completeness. The concepts are applied and illustrated through simulation studies, and several directions for future research are sketched.]]></summary>

We provide multiple applications of these results, including new reduction and summation formulas for finite field hypergeometric functions, along with classical analogues; evaluations of special values of these functions which apply in both the finite field and p-adic settings; and new relations to Fourier coefficients of modular forms.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, let $\mathcal{O}_F$ be the ring of integers of a finite field extension $F$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be a complete valuation ring of rank $1$ and mixed characteristic $(0,p)$. We introduce and study the "integral Hodge polygon", a new invariant of $p$-divisible groups $H$ over $\mathcal{O}_K$ endowed with an action $\iota$ of $\mathcal{O}_F$. If $F|\mathbb{Q}_p$ is unramified, this invariant recovers the classical Hodge polygon and only depends on the reduction of $(H,\iota)$ to the residue field of $\mathcal{O}_K$. This is not the case in general, whence the attribute "integral". The new polygon lies between Fargues' Harder-Narasimhan polygons of the $p$-power torsion parts of $H$ and another combinatorial invariant of $(H,\iota)$ called the Pappas-Rapoport polygon. Furthermore, the integral Hodge polygon behaves continuously in families over a $p$-adic analytic space.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a totally real field and $\mathscr{E}$ the middle-degree eigenvariety for Hilbert modular forms over $F$, constructed by Bergdall--Hansen. We study the ramification locus of $\mathscr{E}$ in relation to the $p$-adic properties of adjoint $L$-values. The connection between the two is made via an analytic twisted Poincar\'e pairing over affinoid weights, which interpolates the classical twisted Poincar\'e pairing for Hilbert modular forms, itself known to be related to adjoint $L$-values by works of Ghate and Dimitrov. The overall strategy connecting the pairings to ramification is based on the theory of $L$-ideals, which was used by Bella\"iche and Kim in the case where $F = \mathbb{Q}$.]]></summary>

In this paper, we introduce a cohomological formulation of a mod $n$ triple symbol for characters over a number field containing a primitive $n$-th root of unity. Our definition is motivated by the arithmetic Chern--Simons theory and in this respect it differs from earlier approaches to triple symbols. We show that our symbol agrees with that of R\'edei when $n=2$ and of Amano--Mizusawa--Morishita when $n=3$.]]></summary>

Abstract: We give an explicit version for van der Corput's $d$-th derivative estimate of exponential sums.
  $ \textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $X$, and $Y\in\mathbb{R}$ be such that $\lfloor Y\rfloor>d$ where $d\ge3$ is a natural number. Let $f\colon(X,X+Y]\to\mathbb{R}$ be a real function with continuous derivatives up to the order $d$. Assume that $0<\lambda\le f^{(d)}(x)\le\Lambda$ for $X<x\le X+Y$. Denote by $D=2^d$. Then \begin{equation}\Bigl|\frac{1}{Y}\sum_{X<n\le X+Y}e(f(n))\Bigr|\le\max\Bigl\{A_d\Bigl(\frac{\Lambda}{\lambda Y}\Bigr)^{2/D}, B_d\Bigl(\frac{\Lambda^2}{\lambda}\Bigr)^{1/(D-2)},C_d(\lambda Y^d)^{-2/D}\Bigr\},\end{equation} where $A_d$, $B_d$, and $C_d$ are explicit constants. They depend on $d$ but for $d\ge2$ for example $A_d< 7.5$, $B_d<5.8$ and $C_d<10.9$.
  We follow the reasoning of van der Corput in three papers published in 1937, that contained an error. I correct this error and try to get the smallest possible constants. We apply this theorem to zeta sums, giving the best choice of $d$ in each case. Also, we prove that our Theorem implies Titchmarsh's Theorem 5.13.]]></summary>

The bulk of the proof concerns p-primary torsion in characteristic p. Our approach gives a more direct proof of the boundedness of the p-primary torsion of the Brauer group of an abelian variety, as recently proved by D'Addezio. We show that the transcendental Brauer group of a Kummer surface over k has finite exponent, but can be infinite when k is an infinite field of positive characteristic.

Abstract: This paper introduces a combinatorial structure of orthogeodesics on hyperbolic surfaces and presents several relations among them. As a primary application, we propose a recursive method for computing the trace (the hyperbolic cosine of the length) of orthogeodesics and establish the existence of surfaces where the trace of each orthogeodesic is an integer. These surfaces and their orthogeodesics are closely related to integral Apollonian circle packings. Notably, we found a new type of root-flipping that transitions between roots in different quadratic Diophantine equations of a certain type, with Vieta root-flipping as a special case. Finally, we provide a combinatorial proof of Basmajian's identity for hyperbolic surfaces, akin to Bowditch's combinatorial proof of the McShane identity.]]></summary>

Abstract: For an isotropic subgroup $H$ of a discriminant form $D$ there exists a lift from modular forms for the Weil representation of the discriminant form $H^\bot/H$ to modular forms for the Weil representation of $D$. We determine a set of discriminant forms such that all modular forms for any discriminant form are induced from the discriminant forms in this set. Furthermore for any discriminant form in this set there exist modular forms that are not induced from smaller discriminant forms.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a field $K.$ We study finite generation properties of the profinite group $\mathrm{Gal}(\Omega/K)$ and of certain closed normal subgroups thereof, where $\Omega$ is the torsion field of $A$ over $K$. In fact, we establish more general finite generation properties for monodromy groups attached to smooth projective varieties via \'etale cohomology. We apply this in order to give an independent proof and generalizations of a recent result of Checcoli and Dill about small exponent subfields of $\Omega/K$ in the number field case. We also give an application of our finite generation results in the realm of permanence principles for varieties with the weak Hilbert property.]]></summary>

Abstract: This paper concerns the characteristic-$p$ fibers of $\mathsf{GU}(q-2,2)$ Shimura varieties, which classify abelian varieties with additional structure. These Shimura varieties admit two stratifications of interest: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. It is natural to ask which Ekedahl-Oort strata intersect the unique closed Newton stratum, called the supersingular locus. In this paper, we present several novel techniques that give information about the interaction between the two stratifications for general signature $(q-2,2)$, and as an application, we completely answer this question for the signature $(3,2)$.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove that Zhang's dynamical Bogomolov conjecture holds uniformly along $1$-parameter families of rational split maps and curves. This provides dynamical analogues of recent results of Dimitrov-Gao-Habegger and K\"uhne. In fact, we prove a stronger Bogomolov-type result valid for families of split maps in the spirit of the relative Bogomolov conjecture. We thus provide first instances of a generalization of a conjecture by Baker and DeMarco to higher dimensions. Our proof contains both arithmetic and analytic ingredients. We establish a characterization of curves that are preperiodic under the action of a non-exceptional split rational endomorphism $(f,g)$ of $(\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}})^2$ with respect to the measures of maximal entropy of $f$ and $g$, extending a previous result of Levin-Przytycki. We further establish a height inequality for families of split maps and varieties comparing the values of a fiber-wise Call-Silverman canonical height with a height on the base and valid for most points of a non-preperiodic variety. This provides a dynamical generalization of a result by Habegger and generalizes results of Call-Silverman and Baker to higher dimensions. In particular, we establish a geometric Bogomolov theorem for split rational maps and varieties of arbitrary dimension.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this article, we are interested in modular forms with non-vanishing central critical values and linear independence of Fourier coefficients of modular forms. The main ingredient is a generalization of a theorem due to VanderKam to modular symbols of higher weights. We prove that for sufficiently large primes $p$, Hecke operators $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_D$ act linearly independently on the winding elements inside the space of weight $2k$ cuspidal modular symbol $\mathbb{S}_{2k}(\Gamma_0(p))$ with $k\geq 1$ for $D^2\ll p$. This gives a bound on the number of newforms with non-vanishing arithmetic $L$-functions at their central critical points and linear independence on the reductions of these modular forms for prime modulo $l\not=p$.]]></summary>

Abstract: A number $m$ is said to be a $\textit{de Polignac number}$, if infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes exist, such that $m$ can be written as the difference of those consecutive prime numbers. Recently in [ W. D. Banks: Consecutive primes and IP sets, arXiv:2403.10637.], using arguments from the Ramsey theory, W. D. Banks proved that the collection of $\textit{de Polignac number}$ is an $IP^\star$ set (Though his original statement is relatively weaker, an iterative application of pigeonhole principle/ theory of ultrafilters shows that this statement is sufficient to conclude the set is $IP^\star$). As a consequence, we have this collection as an additively syndetic set. In this article, we show that this collection is also a multiplicative syndetic set. In our proof, we use combinatorial arguments and the tools from the algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of discrete semigroups (for details see [N. Hindman, and D. Strauss: Algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactification: Theory and Applications, second edition, de Gruyter, Berlin,2012.]).]]></summary>

Abstract: Denote by $J_m$ the Jacobian variety of the hyperelliptic curve defined by the affine equation $y^2=x^m+1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, where $m \geq 3$ is a fixed positive integer. We compute several interesting arithmetic invariants of $J_m$: its decomposition up to isogeny into simple abelian varieties, the minimal field $\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$ over which its endomorphisms are defined, its connected monodromy field $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})$, and its Sato-Tate group. Currently, there is no general algorithm that computes these last two invariants. Furthermore, for large enough values of $m$, the abelian varieties $J_m$ provide non-trivial examples of high-dimensional phenomena, such as degeneracy and the non-triviality of the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})/\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$. We also describe the Sato-Tate group of an abelian variety, generalizing existing results that apply only to non-degenerate varieties, and prove an extension of a well-known formula of Gross-Koblitz that relates values of the classical and $p$-adic gamma functions at rational arguments.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $L$ be a number field and let $\ell$ be a prime number. Rasmussen and Tamagawa conjectured, in a precise sense, that abelian varieties whose field of definition of the $\ell$-power torsion is both a pro-$\ell$ extension of $L(\mu_\ell)$ and unramified away from $\ell$ are quite rare. In this paper, we formulate an analogue of the Rasmussen--Tamagawa conjecture for non-isotrivial abelian varieties defined over function fields. We provide a proof of our analogue in the case of elliptic curves. In higher dimensions, when the base field is a subfield of the complex numbers, we show that our conjecture is a consequence of the uniform geometric torsion conjecture. Finally, using a theorem of Bakker and Tsimerman we also prove our conjecture unconditionally for abelian varieties with real multiplication.]]></summary>

Abstract: We give a short proof of a recent result of Claesson, Dukes, Frankl\'in and Stef\'ansson, that connects tournament score sequences and the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv numbers from additive number theory. We show that this connection is, in fact, an instance of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula from probability theory, and highlight how such formulas can be useful in enumerative combinatorics. Our proof combines renewal theory with the representation of score sequences as lattice paths, due to Erd\H{o}s and Moser in the 1960s. These probabilistic and geometric points of view lead to a simpler proof. A key idea in the original proof and ours is to consider cyclic shifts of score sequences. We observe, however, that this idea is already present in Kleitman's remarks added to one of Moser's final articles in 1968, and in subsequent works by Kleitman. In the same article, Moser conjectured that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{5/2}$ many score sequences of length $n$. Combining the arguments in the current work with those in a recent work by the third author, we demonstrate the utility of the L\'evy-Khintchine method, by giving a short proof of Moser's conjecture.]]></summary>

Abstract: The vector valued theta series of a positive-definite even lattice is a modular form for the Weil representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We show that the space of cusp forms for the Weil representation is generated by such functions. This gives a positive answer to Eichler's basis problem in this case. As applications we derive Waldspurger's result on the basis problem for scalar valued modular forms and give a new proof of the surjectivity of the Borcherds lift based on the analysis of local Picard groups.]]></summary>

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the distribution of primitive lattice points in a symmetric Borel set $S_d\subset\mathbb R^d$ as $d$ goes to infinity, under certain volume conditions on $S_d$. Our main technique involves exploring higher moment formulas for the primitive Siegel transform. We first demonstrate that if the volume of $S_d$ remains fixed for all $d\in \mathbb N$, then the distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Poisson distribution of mean $\frac 1 2$. Furthermore, if the volume of $S_d$ goes to infinity subexponentially as $d$ approaches infinity, the normalized distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Normal distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. We also extend these results to the setting of stochastic processes. This work is motivated by the contributions of Rogers (1955), S$\ddot{\text{o}}$dergren (2011) and Str$\ddot{\text{o}}$mbergsson and S$\ddot{\text{o}}$dergren (2019).]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $m$ be a rational integer $(m \neq 0, \pm 1)$ and consider a pure number field $K = \mathbb{Q} (\sqrt[n]{m}) $ with $n \ge 3$. Most papers discussing the monogenity of pure number fields focus only on the case where $m$ is square-free. In this paper, based on a classical theorem of Ore on the prime ideal decomposition \cite{MN92, O}, we study the monogenity of $K$ with $m$ is not necessarily square-free. As an application, several examples of the application of monogenic fields to CNS (Canonical Number System) are shown. In this way, our results extend some parts of previously established results \cite{BFC, BF, HNHCNS}.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $f(x)=x^4+ax^3+d\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$, where $ad\ne 0$. Let $C_n$ denote the cyclic group of order $n$, $D_4$ the dihedral group of order 8, and $A_4$ the alternating group of order 12. Assuming that $f(x)$ is monogenic, we give necessary and sufficient conditions involving only $a$ and $d$ to determine the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over ${\mathbb Q}$. In particular, we show that $G=D_4$ if and only if $(a,d)=(\pm 2,2)$, and that $G\not \in \{C_4,C_2\times C_2\}$. Furthermore, we prove that $f(x)$ is monogenic with $G=A_4$ if and only if $a=4k$ and $d=27k^4+1$, where $k\ne 0$ is an integer such that $27k^4+1$ is squarefree.

Abstract: By [6], a minimal group $G$ is called $z$-minimal if $G/Z(G)$ is minimal. In this paper, we present the $z$-Minimality Criterion for dense subgroups with some applications to topological matrix groups. For a locally compact group $G$, let $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ be the group of all inner automorphisms of $G,$ endowed with the Birkhoff topology. Using a theorem by Goto [14], we obtain our main result which asserts that if $G$ is a connected Lie group and $H\in\{G/Z(G), \operatorname{Inn}(G)\},$ then $H$ is minimal if and only if it is centre-free and topologically isomorphic to $\operatorname{Inn}(G/Z(G)).$ In particular, if $G$ is a connected Lie group with discrete centre, then $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ is minimal. We prove that a connected locally compact nilpotent group is $z$-minimal if and only if it is compact abelian. In contrast, we show that there exists a connected metabelian $z$-minimal Lie group that is neither compact nor abelian.]]></summary>

In fact, we determine explicit formulas in the cases when $K_1/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is totally ramified and when it is unramified. This builds upon the tamely ramified case, which is a classical consequence of Serre's Mass Formula, exhibiting a more restrictive behavior than in the tamely ramified case because the degrees of such extensions are bounded. As a consequence of the calculation, it is also found that the count depends only on the extension $k/k_1$ of residue fields.]]></summary>

Abstract: All arithmetic non-compact ball quotients by Deligne-Mostow's unitary monodromy group arise as sub-ball quotients of either of two spaces called ancestral cases, corresponding to Gaussian or Eisenstein Hermitian forms respectively. In our previous paper, we investigated the compactifications of the Gaussian Deligne-Mostow variety. Here we work on the remaining case, namely the ring of Eisenstein integers, which is related to the moduli space of unordered 12 points on $\mathbb P^1$. In particular, we show that Kirwan's partial resolution of the moduli space is not a semi-toroidal compactification and Deligne-Mostow's period map does not lift to the unique toroidal compactification. We give two interpretations of these phenomena in terms of the log minimal model program and automorphic forms. As an application, we prove that the above two compactifications are not (stacky) derived equivalent, as the $DK$-conjecture predicts. Furthermore, we construct an automorphic form on the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 4, which is isogenous to the Eisenstein Deligne-Mostow variety, giving another intrinsic proof, independent of lattice embeddings, of a result by Casalaina-Martin, Jensen and Laza.]]></summary>

Abstract: Given a projective smooth curve $X$ over any field $k$, we discuss two notions of global $\mathbb{A}^1$ degree of a finite morphism of smooth curves $f: X \to \mathbb{P}^1_k$ satisfying certain conditions. One originates from computing the Euler number of the pullback of the line bundle $\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1)$ as a generalization of Kass and Wickelgren's construction of Euler numbers. The other originates from the construction of global $\mathbb{A}^1$ degree of morphisms of projective curves by Kass, Levine, Solomon, and Wickelgren as a generalization of Morel's construction of $\mathbb{A}^1$-Brouwer degree of a morphism $f: \mathbb{P}^1_k \to \mathbb{P}^1_k$. We prove that under certain conditions on $N$, both notions of global $\mathbb{A}^1$ degrees of covering maps between modular curves $X_0(N) \to X(1)$, $X_1(N) \to X(1)$, and $X(N) \to X(1)$ agree to be equal to sums of hyperbolic elements $\langle 1 \rangle + \langle -1 \rangle$ in the Grothendieck-Witt ring $\mathrm{GW}(k)$ for any field $k$ whose characteristic is coprime to $N$ and the pullback of $\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(1)$ is relatively oriented.]]></summary>

Moreover, we provide counterexamples to generalizations, which contrasts the case of ordinary approximation where such phenomena do not occur.

Abstract: A commutative ring R is said to be coverable if it is the union of its proper subrings and said to be finitely coverable if it is the union of a finite number of them. In the latter case, we denote by {\sigma}(R) the minimal number of required subrings. In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the ring of integers A of a given number field to be finitely coverable and a formula for {\sigma}(A) is given which holds when they are met. The conditions are expressed in terms of the existence of common index divisors and (or) common divisors of values of polynomials.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this note we prove Sarnak's (spherical) density hypothesis for the full discrete spectrum of the quotients $\Gamma_{\textrm{pa}}(q)\backslash \textrm{Sp}_4(\mathbb{R})$, where $\Gamma_{\textrm{pa}}(q)$ are paramodular groups with square-free level $q$. To derive this estimate we upgrade a density estimate established via the (pre)-Kuznetsov formula, which only accounts for the generic part, using Arthur's parametrization of the discrete spectrum.]]></summary>

Abstract: We study the Iwasawa theory of $p$-primary Selmer groups of elliptic curves $E$ over a number field $K$. Assume that $E$ has additive reduction at the primes of $K$ above $p$. In this context, we prove that the Iwasawa invariants satisfy an analogue of the Riemann--Hurwitz formula. This generalizes a result of Hachimori and Matsuno. We apply our results to study rank stability questions for elliptic curves in prime cyclic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. These extensions are ordered by their absolute discriminant and we prove an asymptotic lower bound for the density of extensions in which the Iwasawa invariants as well as the rank of the elliptic curve is stable.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $F/\mathbb{Q}$ be any totally real number field and $\frak{N}$ an ideal of its ring of integers of norm $N$ and define, for every even $n$, the $[F:\mathbb{Q}]$-dimensional multiweight $\textbf{n}=(n,...,n)$. We prove that for a non CM Hilbert cuspidal Hecke eigenform for $F$, say $f\in S_{\textbf{k}}(\Gamma_0(\frak{N}))$ with $k>2$ even, and a prime $p>\max\{k+1,6\}$ totally split in $F$ such that $p\nmid N$ and such that the residual mod $p$ representation $\overline{\rho}_f$ satisfies that $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)\subseteq \mathrm{Im}(\overline{\rho}_f)$, there exists a lift $\rho_g$ associated to a Hilbert modular cuspform for $F$, say $g\in S_{\textbf{2}}(\frak{N}p^2,\epsilon)$ for some Nebentypus character $\epsilon$ which is supercuspidal at each prime of $F$ over $p$. We also observe that our techniques provide an alternative proof to the corresponding statement for classical Hecke cuspforms already proved by Khare \cite{khare} with classical techniques. Finally, we take the opportunity to include a corrigenda for \cite{dieulefait} which follows from our main result, which provides a congruence that puts the micro good dihedral prime in the level.]]></summary>

Abstract: In the 80's Kudla and Millson introduced a theta function in two variables. It behaves as a Siegel modular form with respect to the first variable, and is a closed differential form on an orthogonal Shimura variety with respect to the other variable. We prove that the Lefschetz decomposition of the cohomology class of that theta function is also its modular decomposition in Eisenstein, Klingen and cuspidal parts. We also show that the image of the Kudla-Millson lift is contained in the primitive cohomology of X. As an application, we deduce dimension formulas for the cohomology of X in low degree. Our results cover the cases of moduli spaces of compact hyperk\"ahler manifolds.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a Hadamard lacunary sequence. We give upper bounds for the maximal gap of the set of dilates $\{a_n \alpha\}_{n \leq N}$ modulo 1, in terms of $N$. For any lacunary sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ we prove the existence of a dilation factor $\alpha$ such that the maximal gap is of order at most $(\log N)/N$, and we prove that for Lebesgue almost all $\alpha$ the maximal gap is of order at most $(\log N)^{2+\varepsilon}/N$. The metric result is generalized to other measures satisfying a certain Fourier decay assumption. Both upper bounds are optimal up to a factor of logarithmic order, and the latter result improves a recent result of Chow and Technau. Finally, we show that our result implies an improved upper bound in the inhomogeneous version of Littlewood's problem in multiplicative Diophantine approximation.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let (X,D) be a projective log pair over the ring of integers of a number field such that the log canonical line bundle K_(X,D) or its dual -K_(X,D) is relatively ample. We introduce a canonical height of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) which is finite precisely when the complexifications of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) are K-semistable. When the complexifications are K-polystable, the canonical height is the height of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) wrt any volume-normalized K\"ahler-Einstein metric on the complexifications of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) The canonical height is shown to have a number of useful variational properties. Moreover, it may be expressed as a limit of periods on the N-fold products of the complexifications of X, as N tends to infinity. In particular, using this limit formula, the canonical height for the arithmetic log surfaces (P_1,D) over the integers, where D has at most three components, is computed explicitly in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function and its derivative at s=-1. Combining this explicit formula with previous height formulas for quaternionic Shimura curves yields a procedure for extracting information about the canonical integral models of some Shimura curves, such as wild ramification. Furthermore, explicit formulas for the canonical height of twisted Fermat curves are obtained, implying explicit Parshin type bounds for the Arakelov metric.]]></summary>

However, I consider that this work is undoubtedly by Riemann. He obtains an $L^\infty$ function whose Fourier transform vanish at the real values $\gamma$ with $\zeta(\frac12+i\gamma)=0$. We give proofs of Riemann formulas. This is an integral representation of the zeta function different from the known ones. I believe this is the first time it has been published.]]></summary>

It is defined in the same algebraic framework as a $q$-analogue of multiple zeta value ($q$MZV) by using a multiple integral. We prove that our deformed multiple zeta value satisfies the double shuffle relations which are satisfied by $q$MZVs. We also prove the extended double Ohno relations, which are proved for ($q$)MZVs by Hirose, Sato and Seki, by using a multiple integral whose integrand contains the hyperbolic gamma function due to Ruijsenaars.]]></summary>
