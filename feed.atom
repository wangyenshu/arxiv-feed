Abstract: In this paper, we conjecture an extension to Bressoud's 1996 generalization of Borwein's famous 1990 conjecture. We then state a few infinite hierarchies of non-negative $q$-series identities which are interesting examples of our proposed conjecture and Bressoud's generalized conjecture. Finally, using certain positivity-preserving transformations for $q$-binomial coefficients, we prove the non-negativity of the infinite families.]]></summary>

Abstract: In 1797, Pfaff gave a simple proof of a ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric series summation formula which was much later reproved by Andrews in 1996. In the same paper, Andrews also proved other well-known hypergeometric identities using Pfaff's method. In this paper, we prove a number of terminating $q$-hypergeometric series-product identities using Pfaff's method thereby providing a detailed account of its wide applicability.]]></summary>

Abstract: We study a 3-dimensional stratum $\mathcal{M}_{3,V}$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_3$ of curves of genus $3$ parameterizing curves $Y$ that admit a certain action of $V= C_2\times C_2$. We determine the possible types of the stable reduction of these curves to characteristic different from $2$. We define invariants for $\mathcal{M}_{3,V}$ and characterize the occurrence of each of the reduction types in terms of them. We also calculate the $j$-invariant (resp. the Igusa invariants) of the irreducible components of positive genus of the stable reduction of $Y$ in terms of the invariants.]]></summary>

Abstract: We address a core partition regularity problem in Ramsey theory by proving that every finite coloring of the positive integers contains monochromatic Pythagorean pairs, i.e., $x,y\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x^2\pm y^2=z^2$ for some $z\in \mathbb{N}$. We also show that partitions generated by level sets of multiplicative functions taking finitely many values always contain Pythagorean triples. Our proofs combine known Gowers uniformity properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions with a novel and rather flexible approach based on concentration estimates of multiplicative functions.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove algebraicity of critical values of certain Spin $L$-functions. More precisely, our results concern $L(s, \pi \otimes \chi, \mathrm{Spin})$ for cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ associated to a holomorphic Siegel eigenform on $\mathrm{GSp}_6$, Dirichlet characters $\chi$, and critical points $s$ to the right of the center of symmetry. We use the strategy of relating the $L$-values to properties of Eisenstein series, and a significant portion of the paper concerns the Fourier coefficients of these Eisenstein series. Unlike in prior algebraicity results following this strategy, our Eisenstein series are on a group $G$ that has no known moduli problem, and the $L$-functions are related to the Eisenstein series through a non-unique model.]]></summary>

Abstract: We study the structure of the Mordell--Weil groups of semiabelian varieties over large algebraic extensions of a finitely generated field of characteristic zero. We consider two types of algebraic extensions in this paper; one is of extensions obtained by adjoining the coordinates of certain points of various semiabelian varieties; the other is of extensions obtained as the fixed subfield in an algebraically closed field by a finite number of automorphisms. Some of such fields turn out to be new examples of Kummer-faithful fields which are not sub-$p$-adic. Among them, we find both examples of Kummer-faithful fields over which the Mordell--Weil group modulo torsion can be free of infinite rank and not free.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $f$ be a quadratic rational function defined over a field of characteristic not equal to $2$. We assume that the critical points of $f$ are all periodic. We first determine the geometric iterated monodromy group up to conjugacy and prove that it is of weakly branch type. This type of result was previously only known for the discrete iterated monodromy groups of PCF quadratic polynomials due to work of Bartholdi and Nekrashevyich.
  Furthermore, motivated by a question of Jones and Levy on settled pairs, we study odometers in the iterated monodromy groups of rational functions. We show that if the critical points have non-intersecting orbits, then the geometric iterated monodromy group always have odometers. If the critical points lie in the same orbit, then we give a divisibility condition depending only on the length $r$ of the postcritical set and $s$ where the critical points are given by $p_1$ and $f^{s-1}(p_1)$. We show that in the absence of odometers in the geometric iterated monodromy group, neither the arithmetic iterated monodromy group of $f$ nor the Arboreal representation attached to $(f,\alpha)$, for any $\alpha \in K$, contains any settled elements. This answers the question of Jones and Levy on settled pairs in negative.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime, and $m,r \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ with $m$ coprime to $p$. In this paper we investigate the real quadratic fields $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m^2p^{2r} + 1})$. We first show that for $m < C$, where constant $C$ depends on $p$, the fundamental unit $\varepsilon$ of $K$ satisfies the congruence $\varepsilon^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod{p^2}$, which implies that $K$ is a non $p$-rational field. Varying $r$ then gives an infinite family of non $p$-rational fields. When $m = 1$ and $p$ is a non-Wieferich prime, we use a criterion of Fukuda and Komatsu to show that if $p$ does not divide the class number of $K$, then the Iwasawa invariants for cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$ vanish. We conjecture that there are infinitely many $r$ such that $p$ does not divide the class number of $K$.]]></summary>

Abstract: A real number $x$ is normal with respect to an integer base $b \geq 2$ if its digit expansion in this base is ``equitable'', in the sense that for $k \geq 1$, every ordered sequence of $k$ digits from $\{0, 1, \ldots, b-1\}$ occurs in the digit expansion of $x$ with the same limiting frequency. Borel's classical result \cite{b09} asserts that Lebesgue-almost every number $x$ is normal in every base $b \geq 2$. This three-part article considers sets of partial normality. Given any choice of integer bases $\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}' \subseteq \{2, 3, \ldots\}$, we investigate measure-theoretic properties of the set $\mathscr{N}(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$, whose members are, by definition, normal in the bases of $\mathscr{B}$ and non-normal in the bases of $\mathscr{B}'$. A pair of sets $(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ is compatible if any $(b, b') \in \mathscr{B} \times \mathscr{B}'$ is multiplicatively independent. For compatible $(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ with $\mathscr{B}' \ne \emptyset$, we construct singular probability measures supported on $\mathscr N(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ that are both Frostman and Rajchman, extending prior work of Pollington \cite{p81} and Lyons \cite{l86}. The Rajchman property completely answers a question of Kahane and Salem \cite{Kahane-Salem-64}, identifying $\mathscr N(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ as a set of multiplicity (in the Fourier-analytic sense) if and only if $(\mathscr{B}, \mathscr{B}')$ is compatible. The methodological contribution of the article is the construction of a class of probability measures called skewed measures. These measures depend on a number of parameters that can be independently adjusted to ensure (subsets of) properties such as almost everywhere normality, non-normality, ball conditions and Fourier decay.]]></summary>

Abstract: The comma sequence (1, 12, 35, 94, \dots) is the lexicographically earliest sequence such that the difference of consecutive terms equals the concatenation of the digits on either side of the comma separating them. The behavior of a ``generalized comma sequence'' depends on the base the numbers are written in, as well as the sequence's initial values. We provide a computational proof that all comma sequences in bases 3 through 19, as well as 22 and 23, are finite. Relying on a combinatorial conjecture, Angelini et al.~estimated that the final element of a comma sequence in base $b$ should be roughly $\exp(O(b))$. We prove their conjecture, but provide evidence that the correct estimate is actually $\exp(O(b \log b))$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Gutierrez and Urroz (2023) have proposed a family of local permutation polynomials over finite fields of arbitrary characteristic based on a class of symmetric subgroups without fixed points called $e$-Klenian groups. The polynomials within this family are referred to as $e$-Klenian polynomials. Furthermore, they have shown the existence of companions for the $e$-Klenian polynomials when the characteristic of the finite field is odd. Here, we present three new families of local permutation polynomials over finite fields of even characteristic. We also consider the problem of the existence of companions for the $e$-Klenian polynomials over finite fields of even characteristic. More precisely, we prove that over finite fields of even characteristic, the $0$-Klenian polynomials do not have any companions. However, for $e \geq 1$, we explicitly provide a companion for the $e$-Klenian polynomials. Moreover, we provide a companion for each of the new families of local permutation polynomials that we introduce.]]></summary>

Abstract: This paper makes the first bridge between the classical differential/boomerang uniformity and the newly introduced $c$-differential uniformity. We show that the boomerang uniformity of an odd APN function is given by the maximum of the entries (except for the first row/column) of the function's $(-1)$-Difference Distribution Table. In fact, the boomerang uniformity of an odd permutation APN function equals its $(-1)$-differential uniformity. We next apply this result to easily compute the boomerang uniformity of several odd APN functions. In the second part we give two classes of differentially low-uniform functions obtained by modifying the inverse function. The first class of permutations (CCZ-inequivalent to the inverse) over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ ($p$, an odd prime) is obtained from the composition of the inverse function with an order-$3$ cycle permutation, with differential uniformity $3$ if $p=3$ and $n$ is odd; $5$ if $p=13$ and $n$ is even; and $4$ otherwise. The second class is a family of binomials and we show that their differential uniformity equals~$4$. We next complete the open case of $p=3$ in the investigation started by G\" olo\u glu and McGuire (2014), for $p\geq 5$, and continued by K\"olsch (2021), for $p=2$, $n\geq 5$, on the characterization of $L_1(X^{p^n-2})+L_2(X)$ (with linearized $L_1,L_2$) being a permutation polynomial. Finally, we extend to odd characteristic a result of Charpin and Kyureghyan (2010) providing an upper bound for the differential uniformity of the function and its switched version via a trace function.]]></summary>

Abstract: For quadratic forms over fields of characteristic different from two, there is a so-called Vishik criterion, giving a purely algebraic characterization of when two quadratic forms are motivically equivalent. In analogy to that, we define Vishik equivalence on quasiliner $p$-forms. We study the question whether Vishik equivalent $p$-forms must be similiar. We prove that this is not true for quasilinear $p$-forms in general, but we find some families of totally singular quadratic forms (i.e., of quasilinear $2$-forms) for which the question has positive answer.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $d$ and $n$ be positive integers, and $E/F$ be a separable field extension of degree $m=\binom{n+d}{n}$. We show that if $|F| > 2$, then there exists a point $P\in \mathbb{P}^n(E)$ which does not lie on any degree $d$ hypersurface defined over $F$. In other words, the $m$ Galois conjugates of $P$ impose independent conditions on the $m$-dimensional $F$-vector space of degree $d$ forms in $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n$. As an application, we determine the maximal dimensions of linear systems $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_2$ of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb P^n$ over a finite field $F$, where every $F$-member of $\mathcal{L}_1$ is reducible and every $F$-member of $\mathcal{L}_2$ is irreducible.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove two results on converse theorems for Hilbert modular forms over totally real fields of degree $r>1$. The first result recovers a Hilbert modular form (of some level) from an $L$-series satisfying functional equations twisted by all the unramified Hecke characters. The second result assumes both the 'unramified' functional equations and an Euler product, and recovers a Hilbert modular form of the expected level predicted by the shape of the functional equations. Our result generalizes the current converse theorems for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ in the case of Hilbert modular forms in that we completely remove the assumptions on ramified twists.]]></summary>

Abstract: For a positive integer $d$, let $p_d(n) := 0^d + 1^d + 2^d + \cdots + n^d$; i.e., $p_d(n)$ is the sum of the first $d^{\mathrm{th}}$-powers up to $n$. It's well known that $p_d(n)$ is a polynomial of degree $d+1$ in $n$. While this is usually proved by induction, once $d$ is not small it's a challenge as one needs to know the polynomial for the inductive step. We show how this difficulty can be bypassed by giving a simple proof that $p_d(n)$ is a polynomial of degree $d+1$ in $n$ by using L'Hopital's rule, and show how we can then determine the coefficients by Cramer's rule. This illustrates a general principle and the point of our paper: there's more than one path to a goal, different approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the more techniques one knows, the more likely one can successfully attack a problem.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this work, we aim to advance the development of a fractal theory for sets of integers. The core idea is to utilize the fractal structure of $p$-adic integers, where $p$ is a prime number, and compare this with conventional densities and counting measures for integers. Our approach yields some results in combinatorial number theory. The results show how the local fractal structure of a set in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ can provide bounds for the counting measure for its projection onto $\mathbb{Z}$. Additionally, we establish a relationship between the counting dimension of a set of integers and its box-counting dimension in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Since our results pertain to sets that are projections of closed sets in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, we also provide both necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for a set $E\subset \mathbb{Z}$ to be the projection of a closed set in $\mathbb{Z}_p$.]]></summary>

For the Weyl groups of types $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$, and $G_2$, we show that the Witt invariants are generated as a $W(k_0)$-algebra by trace forms and their exterior powers, extending a result due to Serre in type $A_n$. Many of our computational methods are applicable to computing Witt invariants of any smooth linear algebraic group over $k_0$, including a technique for lifting module generators from cohomological invariants to Witt invariants.]]></summary>

Abstract: For an algebraic number $\alpha$, let $h(\alpha)$ denote its logarithmic Weil height. In 2002, Bombieri and Zannier obtained lower bounds for Weil height for totally $p$-adic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$, i.e., infinite Galois extension over $\mathbb{Q}$ with finite local degree over a rational prime $p$. In this paper, we formulate and prove the non-Galois analogue of this result. In particular, it leads to a $p$-adic equidistribution result i.e., if a positive proportion of conjugates of $\alpha\in\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ lie in a finite local extension $K_{v}/\mathbb{Q}_p$, then we obtain absolute lower bound for $h(\alpha)$. We also undertake the analoguous problem for canonical height of an elliptic curve $E/K$ and obtain explicit lower bounds for them on certain non-Galois infinite extensions.]]></summary>

Abstract: We characterise abelian surfaces defined over finite fields containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $3$. Firstly, we complete and expand the characterisation of isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus up to $2$ initiated by the first author et al. in previous work. Secondly, we show that, for simple abelian surfaces, containing a curve of genus $3$ is equivalent to admitting a polarisation of degree $4$. Thanks to this result, we can use existing algorithms to check which isomorphism classes in the isogeny classes containing no genus $2$ curves have a polarisation of degree $4$. Thirdly, we characterise isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus $\leq 2$, containing no abelian surface with a polarisation of degree $4$. Finally, we describe absolutely irreducible genus $3$ curves lying on abelian surfaces containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $2$, and show that their number of rational points is far from the Serre--Weil bound.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let U be a homogeneous variety over rational numbers of some linear algebraic group. Fix an integral model and assume the existence of infinitely many integral points. Then one would like to give an asymptotic count with the help of some height function. In many cases, with the help of measure rigidity of unipotent flows, we reduce this problem to one on equivariant birational geometry. For instance, we show that if G and H are both connected, semisimple, simply connected and without compact factors, then U=G/H is strongly Hardy-Littlewood with respect to certain height function. We also show that when H is "large" in H and both G and H are connected, reductive and without non-trivial Q-characters, then for every equivariant height, the asymptotic of integral points is the same as the volume asymptotic up to a constant. Three concrete examples with explicit heights are also provided to illustrate our approach.]]></summary>

Using this fact, we investigate the invariant ring, which relates the homogeneous Jacobi polynomials of the binary codes in genus $g$. Specifically, the generators of the invariant ring appearing for $g=1$ are obtained. Moreover, we define the split Jacobi polynomials in genus~$g$ and obtain the MacWilliams type identity for it.

Abstract: The lattice point problems of the p-circle (e.g., the astroid), which a generalized circle for positive real numbers p, have been solved for approximately p more than 3, based on the series representation of the error term using the generalized Bessel functions by E. Kr"atzel and the results of G. Kuba. On the other hand, for the cases 0 < p < 2, the method via this series representation cannot make progress. Therefore, in such cases, it is necessary to consider another method. In this paper, we prove that certain functions closely related to the problems can be displayed as series by newly generalized Bessel functions based on the property p-radial, generalization of spherical symmetry, and highlight the possibility that attempts to solve the problems via this display are suitable especially for the cases 0 < p < 1 or p=1. This study is based on the harmonic-analytic method by S. Kuratsubo and E. Nakai, using certain functions generalizing the error term of the circle problem by variables and series representation of the functions by the Bessel functions.]]></summary>

Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we develop a general framework that permits a comparison between explicit class field theories for a family of rational function fields $\mathbb{F}_s(t)$ over arbitrary constant fields $\mathbb{F}_s$ and explicit class field theory for the rational function field $\mathfrak{K}(t)$ over the nonprincipal ultraproduct $\mathfrak{K}$ of the constant fields $\mathbb{F}_s$. Under an additional assumption that the constant fields $\mathbb{F}_s$ are perfect procyclic fields, we prove a correspondence between ramifications of primes $P$ in $\mathfrak{K}(t)$ and ramifications of primes $P_s$ in $\mathbb{F}_s(t)$, where the $P_s$ are primes in $\mathbb{F}_s(t)$ whose nonprincipal ultraproduct coincides with $P$.
  In the second part of the paper, we are mainly concerned with rational function fields over a large class of fields, called $n$-th level ultra-finite fields that are a generalization of finite fields. At the $0$-th level, ultra-finite fields are simply finite fields, and for an arbitrary positive integer $n$, an $n$-th level ultra-finite field is inductively defined as a nonprincipal ultraproduct of $(n - 1)$-th level ultra-finite fields. We develop an analogue of cyclotomic function fields for rational function fields over $n$-th level ultra-finite fields that generalize the works of Carlitz and Hayes for rational function fields over finite fields such that these cyclotomic function fields are in complete analogy with the classical cyclotomic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ of the rationals $\mathbb{Q}$. The main result in the second part of the paper is an analogue of the Kronecker--Weber theorem for rational function fields over $n$-th level ultra-finite fields that explicitly describes, from a model-theoretic viewpoint, the maximal abelian extension of the rational function field over a given $n$-th level ultra-finite field for all $n \ge 1$.]]></summary>

Abstract: We consider a variant of the strong multiplicity one theorem. Let $\pi_{1}$ and $\pi_{2}$ be two unitary cuspidal automorphic representations for $\mathrm{GL(2)}$ that are not twist-equivalent. We find a lower bound for the lower Dirichlet density of the set of places for which $\left\lvert a_{v}(\pi_{1}) \right\rvert > \left\lvert a_{v}(\pi_{2}) \right\rvert$, where $a_{v}(\pi_{i})$ is the trace of Langlands conjugacy class of $\pi_{i}$ at $v$. One consequence of this result is an improvement on the existing bound on the lower Dirichlet density of the set of places for which $\left\lvert a_{v}(\pi_{1})\right\rvert \neq \left\lvert a_{v}(\pi_{2}) \right\rvert$.]]></summary>

Abstract: The iterated composition of two operators, both of which are involutions and translation invariant, partitions the set of lattice points in the plane into an infinite sequence of discrete parabolas. Each such parabola contains an associated stairway-like path connecting certain points on it, induced by the alternating application of the aforementioned operators. Any two lattice points in the plane can be connected by paths along the square grid composed of steps either on these stairways or towards taxicab neighbors. This leads to the notion of the parabolic-taxicab distance between two lattice points, obtained as the minimum number of steps of this kind needed to reach one point from the other.
  In this paper, we describe patterns generated by points on paths of bounded parabolic-taxicab length and provide a complete description of the balls centered at the origin. In particular, we prove an earlier conjecture on the area of these balls.]]></summary>

In this article, we give a new proof that $p(D,\mathcal{C})$, the smallest norm of a split prime $\mathfrak{p}\in\mathcal{C}$, satisfies $p(D,\mathcal{C})\ll D^L$ for some absolute constant $L$. Our proof is sieve theoretic. In particular, this allows us to avoid the use of log-free zero-density estimates (for class group $L$-functions) and the repulsion properties of exceptional zeros, two crucial inputs to previous proofs of this result.]]></summary>

This solves the coordination problem in which users wish to sign a petition or commit to a cause, but do not want to be identified as having signed it before enough others have signed it too. We present an implementation of such a petition based on the ElGamal cryptosystem.

To do so we find an asymptotic formula for $z^{th}$-moments of such $h(d)$'s, over $d\leq x$, uniformly for a complex number $z$ in a range of the form $|z|\leq(\log x)^{1+o(1)}$, $\Re(z)\geq -1$.

Abstract: We consider infinite sequences of positive numbers. The connection between log-concavity and the Bessenrodt--Ono inequality had been in the focus of several papers. This has applications in the white noise distribution theory and combinatorics. We improve a recent result of Benfield and Roy and show that for the sequence of partition numbers $\{p(n)\}$ Nicolas' log-concavity result implies the result of Bessenrodt and Ono towards $p(n) \, p(m) > p(n+m)$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Given a closed $n$-manifold, we consider the set of simple homotopy types of $n$-manifolds within its homotopy type, called its simple homotopy manifold set. We characterise it in terms of algebraic $K$-theory, the surgery obstruction map, and the homotopy automorphisms of the manifold. We use this to construct the first examples, for all $n \ge 4$ even, of closed $n$-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent but not simple homotopy equivalent. In fact, we construct infinite families with pairwise the same properties, and our examples can be taken to be smooth for $n \geq 6$.
  Our key examples are homotopy equivalent to the product of a circle and a lens space. We analyse the simple homotopy manifold sets of these manifolds, determining exactly when they are trivial, finite, and infinite, and investigating their asymptotic behaviour. The proofs involve integral representation theory and class numbers of cyclotomic fields. We also compare with the relation of $h$-cobordism, and produce similar detailed quantitative descriptions of the manifold sets that arise.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt projective variety admitting an int-amplified endomorphism $f$, i.e., the modulus of any eigenvalue of $f^*|_{\text{NS}(X)}$ is greater than $1$. We prove Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture for $f$ and also any other surjective endomorphism of $X$: the first dynamical degree equals the arithmetic degree of any point with Zariski dense orbit. This generalizes an early result of Kawaguchi and Silverman for the polarized $f$ case, i.e., $f^*|_{\text{NS}(X)}$ is diagonalizable with all eigenvalues of the same modulus greater than $1$.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove strong hybrid subconvex bounds simultaneously in the $q$ and $t$ aspects for $L$-functions of selfdual $\mathrm{GL}_3$ cusp forms twisted by primitive Dirichlet characters. We additionally prove analogous hybrid subconvex bounds for central values of certain $\mathrm{GL}_3 \times \mathrm{GL}_2$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions. The subconvex bounds that we obtain are strong in the sense that, modulo current knowledge on estimates for the second moment of $\mathrm{GL}_3$ $L$-functions, they are the natural limit of the first moment method pioneered by Li and by Blomer.
  The method of proof relies on an explicit $\mathrm{GL}_3 \times \mathrm{GL}_2 \leftrightsquigarrow \mathrm{GL}_4 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$ spectral reciprocity formula, which relates a $\mathrm{GL}_2$ moment of $\mathrm{GL}_3 \times \mathrm{GL}_2$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions to a $\mathrm{GL}_1$ moment of $\mathrm{GL}_4 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions. A key additional input is a Lindel\"of-on-average upper bound for the second moment of Dirichlet $L$-functions restricted to a coset, which is of independent interest.]]></summary>

We show that if $R$ is not a principal ideal domain, then the symplectic group $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(R)$ has non-trivial rational cohomology in its virtual cohomological dimension. This demonstrates a sharp contrast to the situation where $R$ is Euclidean. To prove our result, we study the symplectic Steinberg module, i.e. the top-dimensional homology group of the spherical building associated to $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(K)$. We show that this module is not generated by integral apartment classes.]]></summary>

We conjecture that as $q \to \infty$, the squares have the maximum possible VC-dimension, viz. $(1+o(1))\log_2 q$. We prove, using the Weil bound for multiplicative character sums, that the VC-dimension is $\geq (\frac{1}{2} + o(1))\log_2 q$. We also provide numerical evidence for our conjectures. The results generalize to multiplicative subgroups $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb F_q^\times$ of bounded index.]]></summary>

Abstract: The term degenerate is used to describe abelian varieties whose Hodge rings contain exceptional cycles -- Hodge cycles that are not generated by divisor classes. We can see the effect of the exceptional cycles on the structure of an abelian variety through its Mumford-Tate group, Hodge group, and Sato-Tate group. In this article we examine degeneracy through these different but related lenses. We specialize to a family of abelian varieties of Fermat type, namely Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves of the form $y^2=x^m-1$. We prove that the Jacobian of the curve is degenerate whenever $m$ is an odd, composite integer. We explore the various forms of degeneracy for several examples, each illustrating different phenomena that can occur.]]></summary>

Abstract: Christol and, independently, Denef and Lipshitz showed that an algebraic sequence of $p$-adic integers (or integers) is $p$-automatic when reduced modulo $p^\alpha$. Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton size for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $\alpha$. We improve this bound to the order of $p^{\alpha^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and degree of the minimal annihilating polynomial. We achieve this bound by showing that all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration system. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our approach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also obtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.]]></summary>

As the first application, we give series expressions of Fourier coefficients of the $n$-th root of certain infinite $q$-products. As the second application, we extend Yves Martin's list of multiplicative holomorphic eta-quotients of integral weights by first extending the meaning of multiplicativity, then identifying one-dimensional spaces, and finally applying Wohlfahrt's extension of Hecke operators. A table containing $2277$ of such eta-quotients is presented. As a related result, we completely classify the multiplier systems induced by eta-quotients of integral exponents. For instance, there are totally $384$ such multiplier systems on $\Gamma_0(4)$ for any fixed weight. We also provide SageMath programs on checking the theorems and generating the tables.]]></summary>

Abstract: Shanks conjectured that $\zeta ' (\rho)$, where $\rho$ ranges over non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, is real and positive in the mean. We present a history of this problem, including a generalisation to all higher-order derivatives $\zeta^{(n)}(s)$, for which the sign of the mean alternatives between positive for odd $n$ and negative for even $n$. Furthermore, we give a simple heuristic that provides the leading term (including its sign) of the asymptotic formula for the average value of $\zeta^{(n)}(\rho)$.]]></summary>

Abstract: It is known after the works of Mahler, Kleinbock, Margulis, Sprind\v{z}uk and others that very well approximated numbers on a manifold form a zero measure set, assuming non-degeneracy conditions. These non-degeneracy conditions are, in many applications, difficult to check. We propose here a setting in which these are automatic. Rather than functions, we consider correspondences which have a better behaviour.]]></summary>

Abstract: For $\alpha>1$, set $\beta=1/(\alpha-1)$. We show that, for every $1<\alpha<(\sqrt{21}+4)/5\approx1.717$, the number of pairs $(m,n)$ of positive integers with $d=\lfloor{n^\alpha}\rfloor - \lfloor{m^\alpha}\rfloor$ is equal to $\beta\alpha^{-\beta}\zeta(\beta)d^{\beta-1} + o(d^{\beta-1})$ as $d\to\infty$, where $\zeta$ denotes the Riemann zeta function. We use this result to derive an asymptotic formula for the number of triplets $(l,m,n)$ of positive integers such that $l<x$ and $\lfloor{l^\alpha}\rfloor + \lfloor{m^\alpha}\rfloor = \lfloor{n^\alpha}\rfloor$. Furthermore, we prove that the additive energy of the sequence $(\lfloor{n^\alpha}\rfloor)_{n=1}^N$, i.e., the number of quadruples $(n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4)$ of positive integers with $\lfloor{n_1^\alpha}\rfloor+\lfloor{n_2^\alpha}\rfloor=\lfloor{n_3^\alpha}\rfloor+\lfloor{n_4^\alpha}\rfloor$ and $n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4\le N$, is equal to $O_\alpha(N^{4-\alpha})$ when $1<\alpha\le4/3$.]]></summary>

Based on the works by Swinnerton-Dyer and Klagsbrun, Mazur, and Rubin, we prove that the probability distribution of the sizes of prime Selmer groups over a family of cyclic prime twists of non-isotrivial elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ satisfying a number of mild constraints conforms to the distribution conjectured by Bhargava, Kane, Lenstra, Poonen, and Rains with explicit error bounds. The key tools used in proving these results are the Riemann hypothesis over global function fields, the Erd\"os-Kac theorem, and the geometric ergodicity of Markov chains.]]></summary>

Using this Hecke equivariance, we show that the sesquiharmonic Maass functions, whose images under the hyperbolic Laplace operator are the Faber polynomials $J_n$ of the $j$-function, form a Hecke system analogous to $J_n$. By combining the Hecke equivariance of the divisor lifting with that of the Borcherds isomorphism, we extend Matsusaka's finding on the twisted traces of sesquiharmonic Maass functions.]]></summary>

We associate to $\rho$ an explicit locally $\mathbb{Q}_p$-analytic representation $\pi_1(\rho)$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$, which encodes some $p$-adic Hodge parameters of $\rho$. When $K=\mathbb{Q}_p$, it encodes the full information hence reciprocally determines $\rho$.

Their work depends on showing that sums $R_k(h)$ of $k$-term singular series are $\mu_k(-h \log h + Ah)^{k/2} + O_k(h^{k/2-1/(7k) + \varepsilon})$, where $A$ is a constant and $\mu_k$ are the Gaussian moment constants. We study lower-order terms in the size of these moments. We conjecture that when $k$ is odd, $R_k(h) \asymp h^{(k-1)/2}(\log h)^{(k+1)/2}$. We prove an upper bound with the correct power of $h$ when $k = 3$, and prove analogous upper bounds in the function field setting when $k =3$ and $k = 5$. We provide further evidence for this conjecture in the form of numerical computations.]]></summary>

  In this paper, we develop some explicit arithmetic on curves of genus $3$, including algorithms to compute the codomain of a decomposed Richelot isogeny. As solutions to compute the domain of a decomposed Richelot isogeny, explicit formulae of defining equations for Howe curves of genus $3$ are also given. Using the formulae, we shall construct an algorithm with complexity $\tilde{O}(p^3)$ (resp. $\tilde{O}(p^4)$) to enumerate all hyperelliptic (resp. non-hyperelliptic) superspecial Howe curves of genus $3$.]]></summary>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of division algebras, the hyperpolyadic algebras, which correspond to the binary division algebras $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$ without considering new elements. First, we use the matrix polyadization procedure proposed earlier which increases the dimension of the algebra. The algebras obtained in this way obey binary addition and a nonderived n-ary multiplication and their subalgebras are division n-ary algebras. For each invertible element we define a new norm which is polyadically multiplicative, and the corresponding map is a $n$-ary homomorphism. We define a polyadic analog of the Cayley-Dickson construction which corresponds to the consequent embedding of monomial matrices from the polyadization procedure. We then obtain another series of n-ary algebras corresponding to the binary division algebras which have a higher dimension, that is proportional to the intermediate arities. Second, a new polyadic product of vectors in any vector space is defined. Endowed with this product the vector space becomes a polyadic algebra which is a division algebra under some invertibility conditions, and its structure constants are computed. Third, we propose a new iterative process ("imaginary tower"), which leads to nonunital nonderived ternary division algebras of half the dimension, which we call "half-quaternions" and "half-octonions". The latter are not subalgebras of the binary division algebras, but subsets only, since they have different arity. Nevertheless, they are actually ternary division algebras, because they allow division, and their nonzero elements are invertible. From the multiplicativity of the introduced "half-quaternion" norm we obtain the ternary analog of the sum of two squares identity. We show that the ternary division algebra of imaginary "half-octonions" is unitless and totally associative.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove a "twist-compatibility" result for p-adic families of cohomology classes associated to symmetric spaces. This shows that a single family of classes (lying in a finitely-generated Iwasawa module) interpolates classical cohomology classes of many different weights, including twists by Gr\"ossencharacters of possibly non-trivial infinity-type. This subsumes and generalises a number of prior results relating to Euler systems and p-adic L-functions, and we conclude with some novel applications to Euler systems for GSp(4), GSp(4) x GL(2), and GSp(4) x GL(2) x GL(2).]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field with $q$ elements and consider the rational function field $K:=\mathbb{F}_q(\theta)$. For a Drinfeld module $\phi$ defined over $K$, we study the transcendence of special values of the Goss $L$-function attached to the abelian $t$-motive $M_{\phi}$ of $\phi$. Moreover, when $\phi$ is a Drinfeld module of rank $r\geq 2$ defined over $K$ which has everywhere good reduction, we prove that the value of the Goss $L$-function attached to the $(r-1)$-st exterior power of $M_{\phi}$ at any positive integer is transcendental over $K$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $q=p^n$ be an odd prime power and let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements. Let $\widehat{\mathbb{F}_q^{\times}}$ be the group of all multiplicative characters of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and let $\chi$ be a generator of $\widehat{\mathbb{F}_q^{\times}}$. In this paper, we investigate arithmetic properties of certain cyclotomic matrices involving nonzero squares over $\mathbb{F}_q$. For example, let $s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_{(q-1)/2}$ be the nonzero squares over $\mathbb{F}_q$. For any integer $1\le r\le q-2$, define the matrix
  $$B_q(r):=\left[\chi^r(s_i+s_j)+\chi^r(s_i-s_j)\right]_{1\le i,j\le (q-1)/2}.$$
  We prove that if $q\equiv 3\pmod 4$, then
  $$\det (B_q(r))=\prod_{0\le k\le (q-3)/2}J_q(\chi^r,\chi^{2k})=

Abstract: This article provides some solutions to Chinburg's conjectures by studying a sequence of the Mahler measure of multivariate exact polynomials. These conjectures assert that for every odd quadratic Dirichlet Character of conductor $f$, $\chi_{-f}=\left(\frac{-f}{.}\right)$, there exists a bivariate polynomial (or a rational polynomial in the weak version) whose Mahler measure is a rational multiple of $L'(\chi_{-f},-1)$. To obtain such solutions for the conjectures we study a polynomial family denoted by $P_d(x,y)$, whose Mahler measure has been fully studied in \cite{mehrabdollahei2021mahler}, and \cite{BGMP}. We demonstrate that the Mahler measure of $P_d$ can be expressed as a linear combination of Dirichlet $L$-functions, which has the potential to generate solutions to the conjectures. Specifically, we prove that this family provides solutions for conductors $f=3,4,8,15,20,24$. Notably, $P_d$ polynomials provide intriguing examples where the Mahler measures are linked to $L'(\chi,-1)$ with $\chi$ being an odd non-real primitive Dirichlet character. These examples inspired us to generalize Chinburg's conjectures from real primitive odd Dirichlet characters to all primitive odd characters. For the generalized version of Chinburg's conjecture, $P_d$ polynomials provide solutions for conductors $5,7,9$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Given an algebraic curve $X$ of genus $\ge 3$, one can construct two algebraic $1$-cycles, the Ceresa cycle and the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal cycle, each living in the Jacobian of $X$ and the triple product $X \times X \times X$ respectively. These two cycles are homologically trivial but are of infinite order in their corresponding Chow groups for a very general curve over $\mathbb{C}$. From the work of S-W Zhang, for a fixed curve these two cycles are non-torsion in their corresponding Chow groups if and only if one of them is. In this paper, we prove that the Ceresa and Gross-Kudla-Schoen cycles associated to a modular curve $X$ are non-torsion in the corresponding Chow groups when $X=\Gamma \backslash \overline{\mathbb{H}}$ for certain congruence subgroups $\Gamma\subset {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We obtain the result by studying a pullback formula for special divisors by the diagonal map $X \hookrightarrow X \times X$.]]></summary>

In this paper, we strengthen and extend a recent work of Mao on the transformation properties of the $NT$ function and provide an analogy of Hickerson and Mortenson's work on the rank function. As an application, we demonstrate how one can deduce from our results many identities involving $NT(r,m,n)$ and another crank-analog statistic $M_\omega(r,m,n)$.

In particular, we show that it is always finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and, whenever $n \geq 2$, is of rank $2$, thereby confirming a prediction made by Hopkins in the early 1990s. In fact, with the exception of the anomalous case $n=p=2$, we provide a full set of topological generators for these groups. Our arguments rely on recent advances in $p$-adic geometry to translate the problem to a computation on Drinfeld's symmetric space, which can then be solved using results of Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol.]]></summary>

McMullen asks for which $n$ these functions are congruence, that is, when they only depend on the image of the cusp $c \in \mathbf{P}^1(\mathcal{O})$ in $\mathbf{P}^1(\mathcal{O}/d)$ for some integer $d$. In this note, we answer McMullen's questions. We obtain our results by computing the exact closure of $\Delta_n \subset \mathrm{SL}_2({\mathcal{O}})$ inside $\mathrm{SL}_2(\widehat{{\mathcal{O}}})$, where $\widehat{{\mathcal{O}}}$ is the profinite completion of ${\mathcal{O}}$.]]></summary>

More specifically, in this paper, we consider the case of the complex dimensions of a lattice (rather than of a nonlattice) self-similar string and show that the corresponding diffraction measure exists, is unique, and is given by a suitable $\textit{continuous}$ analogue of a discrete Dirac comb. We also obtain more general results concerning the autocorrelation measures and diffraction measures of generalized idealized fractals associated to possibly degenerate lattices and the corresponding extension of the Poisson Summation Formula.]]></summary>

Abstract: Denote the virtual cohomological dimension of SL_n(Z) by t=n(n-1)/2. Let St denote the Steinberg module of SL_n(Q) tensored with Q.

We find an explicit generator of H_t(SL_n(Z),St) in terms of sharbly cycles and cosharbly cocycles. These methods may extend to other degrees of cohomology of SL_n(Z).]]></summary>

Abstract: A $K$-Fibonacci sequence is a binary recurrence sequence where $F_0=0$, $F_1=1$, and $F_n=K\cdot F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$. These sequences are known to be periodic modulo every positive integer greater than $1$. If the length of one shortest period of a $K$-Fibonacci sequence modulo a positive integer is equal to the modulus, then that positive integer is called a $\textit{fixed point}$. This paper determines the fixed points of $K$-Fibonacci sequences according to the factorization of $K^2+4$ and concludes that if this process is iterated, then every modulus greater than $3$ eventually terminates at a fixed point.]]></summary>

Abstract: The present paper is devoted to establishing an optimal approximation exponent for the action of an irreducible uniform lattice subgroup of a product group on its proper factors. Previously optimal approximation exponents for lattice actions on homogeneous spaces were established under the assumption that the restriction of the automorphic representation to the stability group is suitably tempered. However, for irreducible lattices in semisimple algebraic groups, either this property does not hold or it amounts to an instance of the Ramanujan-Petersson-Selberg conjecture. Sarnak's Density Hypothesis and its variants bounding the multiplicities of irreducible representations occurring in the decomposition of the automorphic representation can be viewed as a weakening of the temperedness property. A refined form of this hypothesis has recently been established for uniform irreducible arithmetic congruence lattices arising from quaternion algebras. We employ this result in order to establish - unconditionally - an optimal approximation exponent for the actions of these lattices on the associated symmetric spaces. We also give a general spectral criterion for the optimality of the approximation exponent for irreducible uniform lattices in a product of arbitrary Gelfand pairs. Our methods involve utilizing the multiplicity bounds in the pre-trace formula, establishing refined estimates of the spherical transforms, and carrying out an elaborate spectral analysis that bounds the Hilbert-Schmidt norms of carefully balanced geometric convolution operators.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let ${\mathcal X}$ be a category fibered in groupoids over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $k$ be an algebraically closed field containing $\mathbb{F}_q$. Denote by $\phi_k\colon {\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal X}_k$ the arithmetic Frobenius of ${\mathcal X}_k/k$ and suppose that ${\mathcal M}$ is a stack over $\mathbb{F}_q$ (not necessarily in groupoids). Then there is a natural functor $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}\colon{\mathcal M}({\mathcal X})\to{\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X}))$, where ${\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X}))$ is the category of $\phi_k$-invariant maps ${\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal M}$. A version of Drinfeld's lemma states that if ${\mathcal X}$ is a projective scheme and ${\mathcal M}$ is the stack of quasi-coherent sheaves of finite presentation, then $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence.
  We extend this result in several directions. For proper algebraic stacks or affine gerbes ${\mathcal X}$, we prove Drinfeld's lemma and deduce that $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence for very general algebraic stacks ${\mathcal M}$.
  For arbitrary ${\mathcal X}$, we show that $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence when ${\mathcal M}$ is the stack of immersions, the stack of quasi-compact separated \'etale morphisms or any quasi-separated Deligne-Mumford stack with separated diagonal.]]></summary>

Abstract: Given a number field $F_0$ that contains no Hilbert class field of any imaginary quadratic field, we show that under GRH there exists an effectively computable constant $B:=B(F_0)\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ for which the following holds: for any finite extension $L/F_0$ whose degree $[L:F_0]$ is coprime to $B$, one has for all elliptic curves $E_{/F_0}$ that the $L$-rational torsion subgroup $E(L)[\textrm{tors}]=E(F_0)[\textrm{tors}]$. This generalizes a previous result of Gonz\'{a}lez-Jim\'{e}nez and Najman over $F_0=\mathbb{Q}$.
  Towards showing this, we also prove a result on relative uniform divisibility of the index of a mod-$\ell$ Galois representation of an elliptic curve over $F_0$. Additionally, we show that the main result's conclusion fails when we allow $F_0$ to have rationally defined CM, due to the existence of $F_0$-rational isogenies of arbitrarily large prime degrees satisfying certain congruency conditions.]]></summary>

Firstly, we introduce a mapping from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$ crucial for describing these roots, closely tied to their order over the field. Secondly, for any prime $p$, we determine the maximal natural number $n$ such that $\zeta_{p^n}$ defines a quadratic cyclotomic extension over the field $F$. This characterization is uniform across different fields, regardless of their characteristic, and applies to both odd and even primes.]]></summary>

Abstract: The joint moments of the derivatives of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix, and also a variant of the characteristic polynomial that is real on the unit circle, in the large matrix size limit, have been studied intensively in the past twenty five years, partly in relation to conjectural connections to the Riemann zeta-function and Hardy's function. We completely settle the most general version of the problem of convergence of these joint moments, after they are suitably rescaled, for an arbitrary number of derivatives and with arbitrary positive real exponents. Our approach relies on a hidden, higher-order exchangeable structure, that of an exchangeable array. Using these probabilistic techniques, we then give a combinatorial formula for the leading order coefficient in the asymptotics of the joint moments, when the power on the characteristic polynomial itself is a positive real number and the exponents of the derivatives are integers, in terms of a finite number of finite-dimensional integrals which are explicitly computable. Finally, we develop a method, based on a class of Hankel determinants shifted by partitions, that allows us to give an exact representation of all these joint moments, for finite matrix size, in terms of derivatives of Painlev\'e V transcendents, and then for the leading order coefficient in the large-matrix limit in terms of derivatives of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' equation. This gives an efficient way to compute all these moments and coefficients explicitly. Our methods can be used to obtain analogous results for a number of other models sharing the same features.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $x$ be a $p$-adic integer. In this paper, we establish supercongruences for $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{x}{k}\binom{x+k}{k}(-4)^k}{(dk+1)\binom{2k}{k}}\pmod{p^2} $$ and $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{x}{k}\binom{x+k}{k}(-2)^k}{(dk+1)\binom{2k}{k}}\pmod{p^2}, $$ where $d\in\{0,1,2\}$. As consequences, we extend some known results. For example, for $p>3$ we show $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\binom{3k}{k}\left(\frac{4}{27}\right)^k\equiv\frac19+\frac89p+\frac{4}{27}pE_{p-2}\left(\frac13\right)\pmod{p^2}, $$ where $E_n(x)$ denotes the Euler polynomial of degree $n$. This generalizes a known congruence of Z.-W. Sun.]]></summary>

Abstract: In $p$-adic Hodge theory and the $p$-adic Langlands program, Banach spaces with $\mathbb{Q}_p$-coefficients and $p$-adic Lie group actions are central. Studying the subrepresentation of $\Gamma$-locally analytic vectors, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$, is useful because $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ can be analyzed via the Lie algebra $\mathrm{Lie}(\Gamma)$, which simplifies the action of $\Gamma$. Additionally, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ often behaves as a decompletion of $W$, making it closer to an algebraic or geometric object.
  This article introduces a notion of locally analytic vectors for $W$ in a mixed characteristic setting, specifically for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tate algebras. This generalization encompasses the classical definition and also specializes to super-H\"older vectors in characteristic $p$. Using binomial expansions instead of Taylor series, this new definition bridges locally analytic vectors in characteristic $0$ and $p$.
  Our main theorem shows that under certain conditions, the map $W \mapsto W^{\mathrm{la}}$ acts as a descent, and the derived locally analytic vectors $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{la}}^i(W)$ vanish for $i \geq 1$. This result extends Theorem C of \cite{Po24}, providing new tools for propagating information about locally analytic vectors from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$.
  We provide three applications: a new proof of Berger-Rozensztajn's main result using characteristic $0$ methods, the introduction of an integral multivariable ring $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}_{\mathrm{LT}}^{\dagger,\mathrm{la}}$ in the Lubin-Tate setting, and a novel interpretation of the classical Cohen ring ${\mathbf{A}}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ from the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in terms of locally analytic vectors.]]></summary>

Abstract: The Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet heuristics lead one to conjecture that the average size of the $p$-torsion in class groups of $G$-extensions of a number field is finite. In a 2021 paper, Lemke Oliver, Wang, and Wood proved this conjecture in the case of $p = 3$ for permutation groups $G$ of the form $C_2 \wr H$ for a broad family of permutation groups $H$, including most nilpotent groups. However, their theorem does not apply for some nilpotent groups of interest, such as $H = C_5$. We extend their results to prove that the average size of $3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \wr H$-extensions is finite for any nilpotent group $H$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Transfer operators are conjectural "operators of functoriality," which transfer test measures and (relative) characters from one homogeneous space to another. In previous work, I computed transfer operators associated to spherical varieties of rank one, and gave an interpretation of them in terms of geometric quantization. In this paper, I study how these operators vary in the horospherical limits of these varieties, where they have a conceptual interpretation related to scattering theory. I also revisit Jacquet's Hankel transform for the Kuznetsov formula, which is related to the functional equation of the standard L-function of GL(n), and provide an interpretation of it in terms of quantization.]]></summary>

In particular, their work strengthened a previous result of El-Guindy and Ono which expresses a cusp form as a $p$-adic limit of weakly holomorphic modular forms. Subsequently, Hanson and Jameson extended Ahlgren and Samart's result to all one-dimensional cusp form spaces of trivial character and having a normalized form that has complex multiplication.

Abstract: In this paper we study two finite trigonometric sums $\sum a_l\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)\,,$ where $a_l$ are equal either to $\cos(2\pi l \nu/n)$ or to $(-1)^{l+1}$, and where the summation index $l$ and the discrete parameter $\nu$ both run through $1$ to $n-1$ (marginally, cases $a_l=\ln\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)$ and $a_l=\Psi\big(l/n\big)$ also appear in the paper). These sums occur in various problems in mathematics, physics and engineering, and play an important part in some number-theoretic problems. Formally, the first of these sums is also the so-called Dowker sum of order one half. In the paper, we obtain several integral and series representations for the above-mentioned sums, investigate their properties, derive their complete asymptotical expansions and deduce very accurate upper and lower bounds for them (both bounds are asymptotically vanishing). In addition, we obtain a useful approximate formula containing only three terms, which is also very accurate and can be particularly appreciated in applications. Both trigonometric sums appear to be closely related with the digamma function and with the square of the Bernoulli numbers. Finally, we also derive several advanced summation formulae for the gamma and the digamma functions, in which the first on these sums, as well as the product of a sequence of cosecants $\,\prod\big(\csc(\pi l/n)\big)^{\csc(\pi l/n)}$, play an important role.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a $\mathbb{Q}$-Clifford algebra associated to an $(n-1)$-ary positive definite quadratic form and let $\mathcal{O}$ be a maximal order in $K$. A Clifford-Bianchi group is a group of the form $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ with $\mathcal{O}$ as above. The present paper is about the actions of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ acting on hyperbolic space $\mathcal{H}^{n+1}$ via M\"{o}bius transformations $x\mapsto (ax+b)(cx+d)^{-1}$.
  We develop the general theory of orders exhibiting explicit orders in low dimensions of interest. These include, for example, higher-dimensional analogs of the Hurwitz order. We develop the abstract and computational theory for determining their fundamental domains and generators and relations (higher-dimensional Bianchi-Humbert Theory). We make connections to the classical literature on symmetric spaces and arithmetic groups and provide a proof that these groups are $\mathbb{Z}$-points of a $\mathbb{Z}$-group scheme and are arithmetic subgroups of $\operatorname{SO}_{1,n+1}(\mathbb{R})^{\circ}$ with their M\"{o}bius action. We report on our findings concerning certain Clifford-Bianchi groups acting on $\mathcal{H}^4$, $\mathcal{H}^5$, and $\mathcal{H}^6$ .]]></summary>

In \cite{BoCaASc}, Booher and Cais used a sheaf-theoretic approach to give bounds on the $a$-numbers of Artin-Schreier covers. In this paper, that approach is generalized to arbitrary powers of the Cartier operator, yielding bounds for the dimension of the kernel. These bounds give new restrictions on the Ekedahl-Oort type of Artin-Schreier covers.]]></summary>

Abstract: This paper is the fourth and the last part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the Geometric Ramsey Conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we proof a conjecture of Graham on the Remsey properties for spherical configurations in the finite field setting. To be more precise, we show that for any spherical configuration $X$ of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ of complexity at most $C$ with $d$ being sufficiently large with respect to $C$ and $\vert X\vert$, and for some prime $p$ being sufficiently large with respect to $C$, $\vert X\vert$ and $\epsilon>0$, any set $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ with $\vert E\vert>\epsilon p^{d}$ contains at least $\gg_{C,\epsilon,\vert X\vert}p^{(k+1)d-(k+1)k/2}$ congruent copies of $X$, where $k$ is the dimension of $\text{span}_{\mathbb{F}_{p}}(X-X)$. The novelty of our approach is that we avoid the use of harmonic analysis, and replace it by the theory of spherical higher order Fourier analysis developed in previous parts of the series.]]></summary>

Abstract: This paper is the first part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the geometric Ramsey conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we prove a quantitative equidistribution theorem for polynomial sequences in a nilmanifold, where the average is taken along spheres instead of cubes. To be more precise, let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^{d}$ be the preimage of a sphere $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ under the natural embedding from $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ to $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$. We showed that if a rational polynomial sequence $(g(n)\Gamma)_{n\in\Omega}$ is not equidistributed on a nilmanifold $G/\Gamma$, then there exists a nontrivial horizontal character $\eta$ of $G/\Gamma$ such that $\eta\circ g \mod \mathbb{Z}$ vanishes on $\Omega$.
  We also prove quantitative equidistribution and factorization theorems for more general sets arising from quadratic forms defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$. These results will serve as fundamental tools in later parts of the series to proof the spherical Gowers inverse theorem and the geometric Ramsey conjecture.]]></summary>

Abstract: The periodic points of the algebraic function defined by the equation $g(x,y) = x^3(4y^2+2y+1)-y(y^2-y+1)$ are shown to be expressible in terms of Ramanujan's cubic continued fraction $c(\tau)$ with arguments in an imaginary quadratic field in which the prime $3$ splits. If $w = (a+\sqrt{-d})/2$ lies in an order of conductor $f$ in $K$ and $9 \mid N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(w)$, then one of these periodic points is $c(w/3)$, which is shown to generate the ring class field of conductor $2f$ over $K$.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this article, I present a Tauberian equivalence of the Riemann hypothesis within the framework of the theory of regular arithmetic functions, a branch of Tauberian theory that extends the theory of functions with good variation introduced in [Cloitre].
  The central element of this study is the function $\Phi(x)=x\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor$, which allows for the extension of Ingham's summation method [Ingham] far beyond the prime number theorem by linking it to the Riemann hypothesis. I thus demonstrate the following equivalence $$RH\Longleftrightarrow\alpha\left(\Phi\right)=\frac{1}{2}$$ where $\alpha\left(\Phi\right)$ represents the index of good variation of $\Phi$, an essential characteristic of functions of good variation. This equivalence of the Riemann hypothesis is a potential new contribution absent from recent comprehensive catalogs of equivalent of the Riemann hypothesis in mathematical literature [Broughan1, Broughan2].]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a Dirichlet series involving the Fourier$-$Jacobi coefficients of two cusp forms $F,G$ for orthogonal groups of signature $(2,n+2)$. In the case when $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ is a Maass lift of a specific Poincar\'e series, we establish a connection with the standard $L-$function attached to $F$. What is more, we find explicit choices of orthogonal groups, for which we obtain a clear$-$cut Euler product expression for this Dirichlet series. Our considerations recover a classical result for Siegel modular forms, first introduced by Kohnen and Skoruppa, but also provide a range of new examples, which can be related to other kinds of modular forms, such as paramodular, hermitian and quaternionic.]]></summary>

Abstract: In the realm of modern digital communication, cryptography, and signal processing, binary sequences with a low correlation properties play a pivotal role. In the literature, considerable efforts have been dedicated to constructing good binary sequences of various lengths. As a consequence, numerous constructions of good binary sequences have been put forward. However, the majority of known constructions leverage the multiplicative cyclic group structure of finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $p$ is a prime and $n$ is a positive integer. Recently, the authors made use of the cyclic group structure of all rational places of the rational function field over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, and firstly constructed good binary sequences of length $p^n+1$ via cyclotomic function fields over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for any prime $p$ \cite{HJMX24,JMX22}. This approach has paved a new way for constructing good binary sequences. Motivated by the above constructions, we exploit the cyclic group structure on rational points of elliptic curves to design a family of binary sequences of length $2^n+1+t$ with a low correlation for many given integers $|t|\le 2^{(n+2)/2}$. Specifically, for any positive integer $d$ with $\gcd(d,2^n+1+t)=1$, we introduce a novel family of binary sequences of length $2^n+1+t$, size $q^{d-1}-1$, correlation bounded by $(2d+1) \cdot 2^{(n+2)/2}+ |t|$, and a large linear complexity via elliptic curves.]]></summary>

  In this paper, we prove an inverse theorem over finite field for spherical Gowers norms, i.e. a local Gowers norm supported on a sphere. We show that if the $(s+1)$-th spherical Gowers norm of a 1-bounded function $f\colon\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}\to \mathbb{C}$ is at least $\epsilon$ and if $d$ is sufficiently large depending only on $s$, then $f$ correlates on the sphere with a $p$-periodic $s$-step nilsequence, where the bounds for the complexity and correlation depend only on $d$ and $\epsilon$. This result will be used in later parts of the series to prove the geometric Ramsey conjecture in the finite field setting.]]></summary>

Abstract: The Hodge bundle $\omega$ over a modular curve is a square-root of the canonical bundle twisted by the cuspidal divisor, or a theta characteristic, due to the Kodaira--Spencer isomorphism. We prove that, in most cases, a section of a theta characteristic $\nu$ (or any odd power of it) different from $\omega$ is a noncongruence modular form. On the other hand, we show how $\nu\ne\omega$ gives rise to a ``twisted'' analogue of the diagonal period map to a Siegel threefold, whose difference attributes to the stackiness of the moduli of abelian surfaces $\mathcal{A}_{2}$. Some questions on the Brill--Noether theory of the modular curves are answered.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish new explicit bounds for the Mertens function $M(x)$. In particular, we compare $M(x)$ against a short-sum over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$, whose difference we can bound using recent computations and explicit bounds for the reciprocal of $\zeta(s)$. Using this relationship, we are able to prove explicit versions of $M(x) \ll x\exp\left(-\eta_1 \sqrt{\log{x}}\right)$ and $M(x) \ll x\exp\left(-\eta_2 (\log{x})^{3/5} (\log\log{x})^{-1/5}\right)$ for some $\eta_i > 0$. Our bounds with the latter form are the first explicit results of their kind. In the process of proving these, we establish another novel result, namely explicit bounds of the form $1/\zeta(\sigma + it) \ll (\log{t})^{2/3} (\log\log{t})^{1/4}$.]]></summary>

Abstract: The Alder-Andrews Theorem, a partition inequality generalizing Euler's partition identity, the first Rogers-Ramanujan identity, and a theorem of Schur to $d$-distinct partitions of $n$, was proved successively by Andrews in 1971, Yee in 2008, and Alfes, Jameson, and Lemke Oliver in 2010. While Andrews and Yee utilized $q$-series and combinatorial methods, Alfes et al. proved the finite number of remaining cases using asymptotics originating with Meinardus together with high-performance computing. In 2020, Kang and Park conjectured a "level $2$" Alder-Andrews type partition inequality which relates to the second Rogers-Ramanujan identity. Duncan, Khunger, the second author, and Tamura proved Kang and Park's conjecture for all but finitely many cases using a combinatorial shift identity. Here, we generalize the methods of Alfes et al. to resolve nearly all of the remaining cases of Kang and Park's conjecture.]]></summary>

Abstract: Inspired by \cite{DBZ},we generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. For such a substitution, the substitution matrix may have non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector gives the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. We also show that the expansion constant is an algebraic integer under mild conditions. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with contradictory overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We give a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, that is, no such contradiction will emerge. We also give many one-dimensional examples of overlapping substitution. We finish by mentioning a construction of overlapping substitutions from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.]]></summary>

Assuming the Shafarevich-Tate conjecture, we show that if a semistable principally polarised abelian variety $A/\mathbb{Q}$ satisfies the parity conjecture over $\mathbb{Q}$ and over all quadratic fields, then it satisfies it over all number fields. More generally, we establish a criterion for when the parity conjecture for the base change of an abelian variety to a larger number field is already implied by the parity conjecture over the ground field and over other small extensions.]]></summary>

Abstract: We study the arithmetic of curves and Jacobians endowed with the action of a finite group $G$. This includes a study of the basic properties, as $G$-modules, of their $\ell$-adic representations, Selmer groups, rational points and Shafarevich-Tate groups. In particular, we show that $p^\infty$-Selmer groups are self-dual $G$-modules, and give various `$G$-descent' results for Selmer groups and rational points. Along the way we revisit, and slightly refine, a construction going back to Kani and Rosen for associating isogenies to homomorphisms between permutation representations.
  With a view to future applications, it is convenient to work throughout with curves that are not assumed to be geometrically connected (or even connected); such curves arise naturally when taking Galois closures of covers of curves. For lack of a suitable reference, we carefully detail how to deduce the relevant properties of such curves and their Jacobians from the more standard geometrically connected case.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $f_r(x)=\log(1+rx)/\log(1+x)$ for $x>0$. We prove that $f_r$ is a complete Bernstein function for $0\le r\le 1$ and a Stieltjes function for $1\le r$. This answers a conjecture of David Bradley that $f_r$ is a Bernstein function when $0\le r\le 1$.]]></summary>

Abstract: We introduce a condition for Hopf-Galois extensions that generalizes the notion of Kummer Galois extension. Namely, an $H$-Galois extension $L/K$ is $H$-Kummer if $L$ can be generated by adjoining to $K$ a finite set $S$ of eigenvectors for the action of the Hopf algebra $H$ on $L$. This extends the classical Kummer condition for the classical Galois structure. With this new perspective, we shall characterize a class of $H$-Kummer extensions $L/K$ as radical extensions that are linearly disjoint with the $n$-th cyclotomic extension of $K$. This result generalizes the description of Kummer Galois extensions as radical extensions of a field containing the $n$-th roots of the unity. The main tool is the construction of a product Hopf-Galois structure on the compositum of almost classically Galois extensions $L_1/K$, $L_2/K$ such that $L_1\cap M_2=L_2\cap M_1=K$, where $M_i$ is a field such that $L_iM_i=\widetilde{L}_i$, the normal closure of $L_i/K$. When $L/K$ is an extension of number or $p$-adic fields, we shall derive criteria on the freeness of the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_L$ over its associated order in an almost classically Galois structure on $L/K$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ be a strongly unimodal positive integer sequence with peak position $k$. The rank of such sequence is defined to be $\ell-2k+1$. Let $u(m,n)$ denote the number of sequences $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ with rank $m$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{\ell} a_i=n$. Bringmann, Jennings-Shaffer, Mahlburg and Rhoades conjectured that $\{u(m,n)\}_m$ is strongly log-concave for any fixed $n$. Motivated by this conjecture, in this paper we prove the strongly unimodality of $\{u(m,n)\}_m$, that is $u(m,n)>u(m+1,n)$ for $m\ge 0$ and $n\ge \max\{6,{m+2\choose 2}\}$. This result gives supportive evidence for the above conjecture. Moreover, we find a combinatorial interpretation of $u(m,n)$, which leads to a new combinatorial interpretation of ${\rm ospt}(n)$. Furthermore, using this new combinatorial interpretation, a lower bound and an asymptotic formula on ${\rm ospt}(n)$ will be presented.]]></summary>

Instead of $ \mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{Z} {[i]}) \backslash \mathbb{H}^3 $, we establish a spectral large sieve inequality for symmetric squares over $\mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{Z} {[i]}) \backslash \mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{C}) $.

Abstract: Watkins's conjecture suggests that for an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, the rank of the group $E(\mathbb{Q})$ of rational points is bounded above by $\nu_2 (m_E)$, where $m_E$ is the modular degree associated with $E$. It is known that Watkins's conjecture holds on average. This article investigates the conjecture over certain thin families of elliptic curves. For example, for prime $\ell$, we quantify the elliptic curves featuring a rational $\ell$-torsion that satisfies Watkins's conjecture. Additionally, the study extends to a broader context, investigating the inequality $\mathrm{rank}(E(\mathbb{Q}))+M\leq \nu_2(m_E)$ for any positive integer $M$.]]></summary>

Abstract: This monograph elucidates and extends many theorems and conjectures in analytic number theory and algebraic asymptotic analysis via the natural notions of degree and logexponential degree. The Riemann hypothesis, for example, is equivalent to the statement that the degree of the function $\pi(x)- \operatorname{li}(x)$ is $1/2$, where $\pi(x)$ is the prime counting function and $\operatorname{li}(x)$ is the logarithmic integral function. Part 1 of the text is a survey of analytic number theory, Part 2 introduces the notion of logexponential degree and uses it to extend results in algebraic asymptotic analysis, and Part 3 applies the results of Part 2 to the various functions that figure most prominently in analytic number theory.
  Central to the notion of logexponential degree are Hardy's logarithmico-exponential functions, which are real functions defined in a neighborhood of $\infty$ that can be built from $\operatorname{id}$, $\exp$, and $\log$ using the operations $+$, $\cdot$, $/$, and $\circ$. Such functions are natural benchmarks for the orders of growth of functions in analytic number theory. The main goal of Part 3 is to express the logexponential degree of various functions in analytic number theory in terms of as few "logexponential primitives" as possible. The logexponential degree of the function $e^\gamma \prod_{p\leq x}(1-1/p) -1/\log x$, for example, can be expressed in terms of that of $\pi(x)- \operatorname{li}(x)$ and vice versa (where $\gamma \approx 0.5772$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant), despite the fact that very little is known about the logexponential degree of either function separately, even on condition of the Riemann hypothesis.]]></summary>

For polynomials, this establishes a new class of known cases of a conjecture of Andrews-Petsche. Together with a result of Ferraguti-Ostafe-Zannier, this result implies that counterexamples to the conjecture, if they exist, are sparse. We also prove an auxiliary result on places of periodic reduction for rational maps, which may be of independent interest.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a local field of characteristic 0 with residue characteristic $p$. Let $G$ be an extraspecial $p$-group and let $L/K$ be a totally ramified $G$-extension. In this paper we find sufficient conditions for $L/K$ to admit a Galois scaffold. This leads to sufficient conditions for the ring of integers $\mathfrak{O}_L$ to be free of rank 1 over its associated order $\mathfrak{A}_{L/K}$, and to stricter conditions which imply that $\mathfrak{A}_{L/K}$ is a Hopf order in the group ring $K[G]$.]]></summary>

Abstract: This article explains how to practically compute L-invariants of p-new eigenforms using p-adic L-series and exceptional zero phenomena. As proof of the utility, we compiled a data set consisting of over 150,000 L-invariants. We analyze qualitative and quantitative features found in the data. This includes conjecturing a statistical law for the distribution of the valuations of L-invariants in a fixed level as the weights of eigenforms approach infinity. One novel point of our investigation is that the algorithm is sensitive to compiling data for fixed Galois representations modulo p. Therefore, we explain new perspectives on L-invariants that are related to Galois representations. We propose understanding the structures in our data through the lens of deformation rings and moduli stacks of Galois representations.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove that the Hessian transformation of a plane projective cubic corresponds to a $3$-endomorphism of a model elliptic curve. By exploiting this result, we investigate a family of functional graphs -- called Hessian graphs -- defined by the Hessian transformation. We show that, over arbitrary fields of characteristics different from $2$ and $3$, the Hessian graphs inherit distinctive features from the arithmetic of the model curve. We then specialize our analysis to the finite-field case, proving several regularities of Hessian graphs.]]></summary>

Abstract: The cohomology theory TMF of topological modular forms is a derived algebro-geometric interpretation of the classical ring of complex modular forms from number theory. In this article, we refine the classical Adams operations, Hecke operators, and Atkin--Lehner involutions from endomorphisms of classical modular forms to stable operators on TMF. Our algebro-geometric formulation of these operators leads to simple proofs of their many remarkable properties and computations. From these properties, we use techniques from homotopy theory to make simple number-theoretic deductions, including a rederivation of some classical congruences of Ramanujan and providing new infinite families of classical Hecke operators which satisfy Maeda's conjecture.]]></summary>

Our approach is applied to the study of invertible power series, where we notably offer a concise two-line proof of Lagrange's inversion theorem and derive new formulas for both regular and fractional compositional iterates. In addition, we will develop several new insights into umbral operators, including their fractional exponents and novel expressions, in connection with the previously discussed applications. Finally, we discuss both established and new concepts and examples, such as pseudoinverses of delta operators and a natural generalization of Laguerre polynomials.]]></summary>

Abstract: Given an algebraic family $f\colon\Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2 \to \Lambda\times \mathbb{A}^2$ of plane polynomial automorphisms of H\'enon type parameterized by a quasi-projective curve, defined over a number field $\mathbb{K}$, we study the number of periodic points contained in a family of subvarieties $Y\subset \Lambda \times \mathbb{A}^2 \to \Lambda$. Under some mild conditions (e.g., when the family is dissipative), we show that there are only finitely many periodic points contained in a non periodic marked point. This generalizes a result of Charles Favre and Romain Dujardin. We also show that there is a uniform bound on the number of periodic points in a family of curves $Y_t, t\in \Lambda$, when $Y$ is non-degenerate. Then we study in more details the case of dissipative families of quadratic H\'enon maps.]]></summary>

Our proof relies on a new result of independent interest; we use a filtered variant of the Waldhausen construction to show that Quillen's spectral sequence abutting to the cohomology of $BK(\mathbb{Z})$ is a spectral sequence of Hopf algebras. From the same construction, we also deduce that $\dim H^{\binom{n}{2} - n - k}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}))$ grows at least exponentially with $n$, for $k = -1$ and for all but finitely many non-negative integers $k$.]]></summary>

Using only the first $n+1$ terms of this series, we define the remainder \[\mathcal{R}_n = \frac{p}{\pi} - \sum_{k=0}^n u_k=\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty u_k.\] We consider an asymptotic expansion of $\mathcal{R}_n$. More precisely, we provide a recursive relation for determining the coefficients $c_j$ such that \[ \mathcal{R}_n = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)_n \left(q\right)_n \left(1-q\right)_n}{n!^3}nt^n\left(\sum_{j=0}^{J-1}\frac{c_j}{n^j}+\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-J}\right)\right),\qquad n \rightarrow \infty.\] Here we need $J<\infty$ to approximate $\mathcal{R}_n$, because (like the Stirling series) this series diverges if $J\rightarrow\infty$.

We also establish the metric PPC for $(n^{\theta_1},\ldots,n^{\theta_d})$ provided that the $\theta_i$'s are greater than one.

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Fuchsian group in ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. In this note, we discuss the existence of $\rho$-equivariant functions for a two-dimensional representation $\rho$ of $\Gamma$. This assertion was first stated by Saber and Sebbar in 2020, and this note partially fills a gap of their statement by proving the assertion for a certain class of Fuchsian groups such as conjugates of subgroups of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $Z(N)$ denote the minimum number of zeros in $[0,2\pi]$ that a cosine polynomial of the form $$f_A(t)=\sum_{n\in A}\cos nt$$ can have when $A$ is a finite set of non-negative integers of size $|A|=N$. It is an old problem of Littlewood to determine $Z(N)$. In this paper, we obtain the lower bound $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log N)^{(1+o(1))}$ which exponentially improves on the previous best bounds of the form $Z(N)\geqslant (\log\log\log N)^c$ due to Erd\'elyi and Sahasrabudhe.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper we study certain families of motives, which arise as direct summands of the cohomology of the Dwork family. We computationally find examples of interesting families with the following three properties. Firstly, their geometric monodromy group is Zariski dense in $\operatorname{SL}_n$. Secondly, they realise many different unipotent operators as the monodromy operator at $t = \infty$. Thirdly, all their Hodge numbers are $\leq 1$.
  This has consequences for Galois representations. Namely, if a nilpotent operator $N$ appears as the monodromy at $t = \infty$ in one of our families, we can construct potentially automorphic representations with $\ell$-adic monodromy given by $N$ at a fixed prime $p$. As another application, we obtain a new proof of some cases of the recent local-global compatibility theorem of Matsumoto.]]></summary>

Our heuristic applies to smooth surfaces defined by cubic polynomials that are log K3, but it can also be adjusted to handle singular cubic surfaces. We compare our heuristic to Heath-Brown's prediction for sums of three cubes, as well as to asymptotic formulae in the literature around Zagier's work on the Markoff cubic surface, and work of Baragar and Umeda on further surfaces of Markoff-type. We also test our heuristic against numerical data for several families of cubic surfaces.]]></summary>

Abstract: In a letter to Weierstrass Riemann asserted that the number $N_0(T)$ of zeros of $\zeta(s)$ on the critical line to height $T$ is approximately equal to the total number of zeros to this height $N(T)$. Siegel studied some posthumous papers of Riemann trying to find a proof of this. He found a function $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$ whose zeros are related to the zeros of the function $\zeta(s)$. Siegel concluded that Riemann's papers contained no ideas for a proof of his assertion, connected the position of the zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$ with the position of the zeros of $\zeta(s)$ and asked about the position of the zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$. This paper is a summary of several papers that we will soon upload to arXiv, in which we try to answer Siegel's question about the position of the zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$. The articles contain also improvements on Siegel's results and also other possible ways to prove Riemann's assertion, but without achieving this goal.]]></summary>

Abstract: We describe Gauss-type maps as geometric realizations of certain codes in the monoid of nonnegative matrices in the extended modular group. Each such code, together with an appropriate choice of unimodular intervals in P^1R, determines a dual pair of graph-directed iterated function systems, whose attractors contain intervals and constitute the domains of a dual pair of Gauss-type maps. Our framework covers many continued fraction algorithms (such as Farey fractions, Ceiling, Even and Odd, Nearest Integer, ...) and provides explicit dual algorithms and characterizations of those quadratic irrationals having a purely periodic expansion.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective smooth geometrically connected curve defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of cardinality $q$. Let $S$ be a finite set of closed points of $X$. Let $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{S}$ be the base change of $X$, $S$ to an algebraic closure. We consider the set of $\ell$-adic ($\ell\nmid q$) local systems of rank $n$ over $\bar{X}-\bar{S}$ with prescribed tame regular semisimple and generic ramifications in $\bar{S}$. The genericity ensures that such an $\ell$-adic local system is automatically irreducible. We show that the number of these $\ell$-adic local systems fixed by Frobenius endomorphism equals the number of stable logarithmic Higgs bundles of rank $n$ and degree $e$ coprime to $n$, with a fixed residue, up to a power of $q$. In the split case, this number is equal to the number of stable parabolic Higgs bundles (with full flag structures) fixed by $\mathbb{G}_m$-action with generic parabolic weights.]]></summary>

Abstract: Blokhuis showed that all maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order have a subfield structure. Recently, it has been shown that in Peisert-type graphs, all maximum cliques are affine subspaces, and yet some maximum cliques do not arise from a subfield. In this paper, we investigate the existence of a clique of size $\sqrt{q}$ with a subspace structure in pseudo-Paley graphs of order $q$ from unions of semi-primitive cyclotomic classes. We show that such a clique must have an equal contribution from each cyclotomic class and that most such pseudo-Paley graphs do not admit such cliques, suggesting that the Delsarte bound $\sqrt{q}$ on the clique number can be improved in general. We also prove that generalized Peisert graphs are not isomorphic to Paley graphs or Peisert graphs, confirming a conjecture of Mullin.]]></summary>

Our approaches rely on studying the behavior of products of two theta series under the action of the huffing operator. For this purpose, some explicit criteria are given. We may use the presented methods to not only verify experimentally discovered coefficient-vanishing results, but also to produce a series of general phenomena.]]></summary>

We show that algebraic relations of $v$-adic arithmetic gamma values over $\mathbb{F}_q(\theta)$ are explained by the standard functional equations together with Thakur's analogue of the Gross-Koblitz formula. A key step is working out a formula expressing $v$-adic crystalline-de Rham periods of Carlitz motives with Complex Multiplication as products of these special gamma values (a $v$-adic Chowla-Selberg formula). The algebraic independence of those periods in question results from determining the dimension of the motivic Galois groups, adapting and further developing existing tools.]]></summary>

Abstract: Viazovska's solution of the sphere packing problem in eight dimensions is based on a remarkable construction of certain special functions using modular forms. Great mathematics has consequences far beyond the problems that originally inspired it, and Viazovska's work is no exception. In this article, we'll examine how it has led to new interpolation theorems in Fourier analysis, specifically a theorem of Radchenko and Viazovska.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper, the power series and hypergeometric series representations of the beta and Ramanujan functions \begin{equation*} \mathcal{B}\left( x\right) =\frac{\Gamma \left( x\right)^{2}}{\Gamma \left( 2x\right) }\text{ and }\mathcal{R}\left( x\right) =-2\psi \left( x\right) -2\gamma \end{equation*} are presented, which yield higher order monotonicity results related to $ \mathcal{B}(x)$ and $\mathcal{R}(x)$; the decreasing property of the functions $\mathcal{R}\left( x\right) /\mathcal{B}\left( x\right) $ and $[ \mathcal{B}(x) -\mathcal{R}(x)] /x^{2}$ on $\left( 0,\infty \right)$ are proved. Moreover, a conjecture put forward by Qiu et al. in [17] is proved to be true. As applications, several inequalities and identities are deduced. These results obtained in this paper may be helpful for the study of certain special functions. Finally, an interesting infinite series similar to Riemann zeta functions is observed initially.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{F}$ be a nonarchimedean local field of residual characteristic $p$, and let $G$ denote the group of $\mathfrak{F}$-points of a connected reductive group over $\mathfrak{F}$. For an open compact subgroup $\mathcal{U}$ of $G$ and a unital commutative ring $k$, we let $\mathbf{X}_{\mathcal{U}}$ denote the space of compactly supported $k$-valued functions on $G/\mathcal{U}$. Building on work of Ollivier--Schneider, we investigate the graded $\textrm{Ext}$-algebra $E_{\mathcal{U}}^* := \textrm{Ext}_G^*(\mathbf{X}_{\mathcal{U}},\mathbf{X}_{\mathcal{U}})^{\textrm{op}}$. In particular, we describe the Yoneda product, an involutive anti-automorphism, and (when $k$ is a field of characteristic $p$ and $\mathcal{U}$ has no $p$-torsion) a duality operation. We allow for the reductive group to be non-split, and for the open compact subgroup $\mathcal{U}$ to be non-pro-$p$.
  Specializing further to the case $G = \textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ with $p \geq 5$ and a coefficient field of characteristic $p$, we obtain more precise results when $\mathcal{U}$ is equal to an Iwahori subgroup $J$ or a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup $K$. In particular, we compute the structure of $E_J^*$ as an $E_J^0$-bimodule, obtain an explicit description of the center $\mathcal{Z}(E_J^*)$ of $E_J^*$, and construct a surjective morphism of algebras $\mathcal{Z}(E_J^*) \longrightarrow E_K^*$ (analogous to the compatibility between Bernstein and Satake isomorphisms in characteristic 0). From this we deduce the (somewhat surprising) fact that $E_K^*$ is not graded-commutative, contrary to what happens for almost all $\ell$-modular characteristics.]]></summary>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of Galois orbits of algebraic points with small height in a projective variety over a number field. Our main result is a generalization of Yuan's equidistribution theorem that does not require Zhang's lower bound for the essential minimum to be attained. It extends to all projective varieties a theorem of Burgos Gil, Philippon, Rivera-Letelier and the second author for toric varieties, and implies the semiabelian equidistribution theorem of K\"uhne. We also generalize previous work of Chambert-Loir and Thuillier to prove new logarithmic equidistribution results. In the last section, we extend our main theorem to the quasi-projective setting recently introduced by Yuan and Zhang.]]></summary>

Abstract: We estimate the number of zeros of a polynomial in $\mathbb{C}[z]$ within any small circular disc centered on the unit circle, which improves and comprehensively extends a result established by Borwein, Erd{\'e}lyi, and Littmann~\cite{BE1} in 2008. Furthermore, by combining this result with Euclidean geometry, we derive an upper bound on the number of zeros of such a polynomial within a region resembling a gear wheel. Additionally, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the annular discrepancy of such zeros near the unit circle. Our approach builds upon a modified version of the method described in \cite{BE1}, combined with the refined version of the best-known upper bound for angular discrepancy of zeros of polynomials.]]></summary>

This is still an unanswered question asked by N. Hindman. Joel Moreira in [J. Moreira, Monochromatic sums and products in N, Annals of Mathematics 185 (2017) 1069-1090] established a partial answer to this question and proved that for infinitely many $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$, $\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$ for some $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$, which is called Moreira's Theorem. Recently, H. Hindman and D. Strauss established a refinement of Moreira's Theorem and proved that for infinitely many $y$, $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is a piecewise syndetic set. In this article, we will prove infinitely many $y\in FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ such that $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{xy,x+f(y):f\in F\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is piecewise syndetic, where $F$ is a finite subset of $x\mathbb{Z}\left[x\right]$. $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ and $FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ is the set of all finite products of $\mathbb{P}-1$.]]></summary>

Abstract: For every group $\{\pm1\}\subseteq \Delta\subseteq (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^\times$, there exists an intermediate modular curve $X_\Delta(N)$. In this paper we determine all curves $X_\Delta(N)$ whose $\mathbb{Q}$-gonality is equal to $4$, all curves $X_\Delta(N)$ whose $\mathbb{C}$-gonality is equal to $4$, and all curves $X_\Delta(N)$ whose $\mathbb{Q}$-gonality is equal to $5$. We also determine the $\mathbb{Q}$-gonality of all curves $X_\Delta(N)$ for $N\leq 40$ and $\{\pm1\}\subsetneq \Delta \subsetneq (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^\times$.]]></summary>

Abstract: In two papers entitled ``Two generalizations of almost perfect nonlinearity" and ``On the vector subspaces of $\mathbb F_{2^n}$ over which the multiplicative inverse function sums to zero", the first author has introduced and studied the notion of sum-freedom of vectorial functions, which expresses that a function sums to nonzero values over all affine subspaces of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ of a given dimension $k\geq 2$, and he then focused on the $k$th order sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $x\in \Bbb F_{2^n}\mapsto x^{2^n-2}$. Some general results were given for this function (in particular, the case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the cases of $k\in \{3,n-3\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well (negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\in [\![ 4;n-4]\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a continuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles, the particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the Frobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small enough (approximately, $3\le k\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free. Finally, we extend a result previously obtained in the second paper mentioned above, and we deduce in particular that, for any even $n$ and every $2\leq k\leq n-2$, the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free.]]></summary>

Abstract: The Katz-Sarnak philosophy states that statistics of zeros of $L$-function families near the central point as the conductors tend to infinity agree with those of eigenvalues of random matrix ensembles as the matrix size tends to infinity. While numerous results support this conjecture, S. J. Miller observed that for finite conductors, very different behavior can occur for zeros near the central point in elliptic curve $L$-function families. This led to the creation of the excised model of Due\~{n}ez, Huynh, Keating, Miller, and Snaith, whose predictions for quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve are well fit by the data. The key ingredients are relating the discretization of central values of the $L$-functions to excising matrices based on the value of the characteristic polynomials at 1 and using lower order terms (in statistics such as the one-level density and pair-correlation) to adjust the matrix size. We extended this model for a family of twists of an $L$-function associated to a given holomorphic cuspidal newform of odd prime level and arbitrary weight. We derive the corresponding "effective" matrix size for a given form by computing the one-level density and pair-correlation statistics for a chosen family of twists, and we show there is no repulsion for forms with weight greater than 2 and principal nebentype. We experimentally verify the accuracy of the model, and as expected, our model recovers the elliptic curve model.]]></summary>

Abstract: The supersingular locus of the $\mathrm{GU}(1,n-1)$ Shimura variety at a ramified prime $p$ is stratified by Coxeter varieties attached to finite symplectic groups. In this paper, we compute the $\ell$-adic cohomology of the Zariski closure of any such stratum. These are known as closed Bruhat-Tits strata. We prove that the cohomology groups of odd degree vanish, and those of even degree are explicitely determined as representations of the symplectic group with a Frobenius action. Each closed Bruhat-Tits stratum is linearly stratified by Coxeter varieties attached to smaller symplectic groups. Thanks to results of Lusztig who computed the cohomology of Coxeter varieties for classical groups, we make use of the spectral sequence associated to this stratification and describe explicitely all the terms at infinity. We point out that the closed Bruhat-Tits strata have isolated singularities when the dimension is greater than 1. Our analysis requires discussing the smoothness of the blow-up at the singular points, as well as comparing the ordinary $\ell$-adic cohomology with intersection cohomology. A by-product of our computations is that these two cohomologies actually coincide, so that surprisingly the presence of singularities does not interfere with the cohomology.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the cohomology of the unitary unramified PEL Rapoport-Zink space of signature $(1,n-1)$ at maximal level. Our method revolves around the spectral sequence associated to the open cover by the analytical tubes of the closed Bruhat-Tits strata in the special fiber, which were constructed by Vollaard and Wedhorn. The cohomology of these strata, which are isomorphic to generalized Deligne-Lusztig varieties, has been computed in a previous paper. This spectral sequence allows us to prove the semisimplicity of the Frobenius action and the non-admissibility of the cohomology in general. Via $p$-adic uniformization, we relate the cohomology of the Rapoport-Zink space to the cohomology of the supersingular locus of a Shimura variety with no level at $p$. In the case $n=3$ or $4$, we give a complete description of the cohomology of the supersingular locus in terms of automorphic representations.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the study of minimal torsion curves within a fixed geometric isogeny class. For a $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-isogeny class $\mathcal{E}$ of elliptic curves and $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, we wish to determine the least degree of a point on the modular curve $X_1(N)$ associated to any $E \in \mathcal{E}$. In the present work, we consider the cases where $\mathcal{E}$ is rational, i.e., contains an elliptic curve with rational $j$-invariant, or where $\mathcal{E}$ consists of elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM). If $N=\ell^k$ is a power of a single prime, we give a complete characterization upon restricting to points of odd degree, and also in the case where $\mathcal{E}$ is CM. We include various partial results in the more general setting.]]></summary>

This extends, in several ways, a recent observation due to Galbraith, Perrin and Voloch for the ray class group. We show that this leads to a reinterpretation of the action of the class group of a suborder $O' \subseteq O$ on the set of $O'$-oriented elliptic curves, discuss several other examples, and briefly comment on the hardness of the corresponding vectorization problems.]]></summary>

The results are achieved by proving that, given any multivariate polynomial within a general class, the absolute value of the polynomial over an expanding box is typically bounded by a fixed power of its radical.

Abstract: For an elliptic curve defined over a number field, the absolute Galois group acts on the group of torsion points of the elliptic curve, giving rise to a Galois representation in $\GL(\hat{\Z})$. The obstructions to the surjectivity of this representation are either local (\emph{i.e.} at a prime), or due to nonsurjectivity on the product of local Galois images. In this article, we study an extreme case: the coincidence \emph{i.e.} the equality of $n$-division fields, generated by the $n$-torsion points, attached to different positive integers~$n$. We give necessary conditions for coincidences, dealing separately with vertical coincidences, at a given prime, and horizontal coincidences, across multiple primes, in particular when the Galois group on the $n$-torsion contains the special linear group. We also give a non-trivial construction for coincidences not occurring over $\Q$.]]></summary>

By developing $p$-adic Hodge theory for general valuation rings, we establish a geometric analogue of Sen's criterion for any $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic varieties: its (Riemann-Zariski) stalkwise perfectoidness is necessary for the non-vanishing of the geometric Sen operators. As the latter is verified for general Shimura varieties by Pan and Camargo, we obtain the perfectoidness of every completed stalk of general Shimura varieties at infinite level at $p$. As an application, we prove that the integral completed cohomology groups vanish in higher degrees, verifying a conjecture of Calegari-Emerton for general Shimura varieties.]]></summary>

Abstract: We develop the foundations of a general framework for producing optimal upper and lower bounds on the sum $\sum_p a_p$ over primes $p$, where $(a_n)_{x/2<n\le x}$ is an arbitrary non-negative sequence satisfying Type I and Type II estimates.
  Our lower bounds on $\sum_p a_p$ depend on a new sieve method, which is non-iterative and uses all of the Type I and Type II information at once. We also give a complementary general procedure for constructing sequences $(a_n)$ satisfying the Type I and Type II estimates, which in many cases proves that our lower bounds on $\sum_p a_p$ are best possible. A key role in both the sieve method and the construction method is played by the geometry of special subsets of $\mathbb{R}^k$.
  This allows us to determine precisely the ranges of Type I and Type II estimates for which an asymptotic for $\sum_p a_p$ is guaranteed, that a substantial Type II range is always necessary to guarantee a non-trivial lower bound for $\sum_p a_p$, and to determine the optimal bounds in some naturally occurring families of parameters from the literature. We also demonstrate that the optimal upper and lower bounds for $\sum_p a_p$ exhibit many discontinuities with respect to the Type I and Type II ranges, ruling out the possibility of a particularly simple characterization.]]></summary>

Abstract: Booher, Cais, Kramer-Miller and Upton study a class of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-tower of curves in characteristic $p$ with ramification controlled by an integer $d$. In the special case that $d$ divides $p-1$, they prove a formula for the higher $a$-numbers of these curves involving the number of lattice points in a complicated region of the plane. Booher and Cais had previously conjectured that for $n$ sufficiently large the higher $a$-numbers of the $n$th curve are given by formulae of the form $\alpha(n) p^{2n} + \beta(n) p^n + \lambda_r(n) n + \nu(n) $ for $n$ sufficiently large, where $\alpha,\beta,\nu,\lambda_r$ are periodic functions of $n$. This is an example of a new kind of Iwasawa theory. We establish this conjecture by carefully studying these lattice points.]]></summary>

Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.]]></summary>

Abstract: This work concerns asymptotical stabilisation phenomena occurring in the moduli space of sections of certain algebraic families over a smooth projective curve, whenever the generic fibre of the family is a smooth projective Fano variety, or not far from being Fano.
  We describe the expected behaviour of the class, in a ring of motivic integration, of the moduli space of sections of given numerical class. Up to an adequate normalisation, it should converge, when the class of the sections goes arbitrarily far from the boundary of the dual of the effective cone, to an effective element given by a motivic Euler product. Such a principle can be seen as an analogue for rational curves of the Batyrev-Manin-Peyre principle for rational points.
  The central tool of this article is the property of equidistribution of curves. We show that this notion does not depend on the choice of a model of the generic fibre, and that equidistribution of curves holds for smooth projective split toric varieties. As an application, we study the Batyrev-Manin-Peyre principle for curves on a certain kind of twisted products.]]></summary>

Abstract: For a prime $p$ and a rational elliptic curve $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$, set $K=\mathbb{Q}(E[p])$ to denote the torsion field generated by $E[p]:=\operatorname{ker}\{E\xrightarrow{p} E\}$. The class group $\operatorname{Cl}_K$ is a module over $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$. Given a fixed odd prime number $p$, we study the average non-vanishing of certain Galois stable quotients of the mod-$p$ class group $\operatorname{Cl}_K/p\operatorname{Cl}_K$. Here, $E$ varies over rational elliptic curves, ordered according to \emph{height}. Our results are conditional and rely on predictions made by Delaunay and Poonen-Rains for the statistical variation of the $p$-primary parts of Tate-Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves. We also prove results in the case when the elliptic curve $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ is fixed and the prime $p$ is allowed to vary.]]></summary>

Abstract: In this note we study common preperiodic points of rational maps of the Riemann Sphere. We show that given any degrees $d_1,d_2\geq2$, outside a Zariski closed subset of the space of pairs of rational maps $(f,g)$ of degree $d_1$ and $d_2$ respectively, the maps $f$ and $g$ share at most a uniformly bounded number of common preperiodic points. This generalizes a result of DeMarco and Mavraki to maps of possibly different degrees. Our main contribution is the use of H\"older properties of the Green function of a rational map to obtain height estimates.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $\Lambda_X(s)=\det(I-sX^{\dagger})$ be the characteristic polynomial of the unitary matrix $X$. It is believed that the distribution of values of $\Lambda_X(s)$ model the distribution of values of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. This principle motivates many avenues of study. Of particular interest is the behavior of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ and the distribution of its zeros (all of which lie inside or on the unit circle). In this article we present several identities for the moments of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ averaged over $U(N)$, for $x \in \mathbb{C}$ as well as specialized to $|x|=1$. Additionally, we prove, for positive integer $k$, that the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X(1)|^{2k} dX$ of degree $k^2$ in $N$ divides the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X'(1)|^{2k} dX$ which is of degree $k^2+2k$ in $N$ and that the ratio, $f(N,k)$, of these moments factors into linear factors modulo $4k-1$ if $4k-1$ is prime. We also discuss the relationship of these moments to a solution of a second order non-linear Painl\'{e}ve differential equation. Finally we give some formulas in terms of the $_3F_2$ hypergeometric series for the moments in the simplest case when $N=2$, and also study the radial distribution of the zeros of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ in that case.]]></summary>

Abstract: A number is normal in base $b$ if, in its base $b$ expansion, all blocks of digits of equal length have the same asymptotic frequency. The rate at which a number approaches normality is quantified by the classical notion of discrepancy, which indicates how far the scaling of the number by powers of $b$ is from being equidistributed modulo 1. This rate is known as the discrepancy of a normal number. The Champernowne constant $c_{10} = 0.12345678910111213141516\ldots$ is the most well-known example of a normal number. In 1986, Schiffer provided the discrepancy of numbers in a family that includes the Champernowne constant. His proof relies on exponential sums. Here, we present a discrete and elementary proof specifically for the discrepancy of the Champernowne constant.]]></summary>

Abstract: GT-shadows are tantalizing objects that can be thought of as approximations of elements of the mysterious Grothendieck-Teichmueller group $\widehat{GT}$ introduced by V. Drinfeld in 1990. GT-shadows form a groupoid GTSh whose objects are finite index subgroups of the pure braid group PB_4, that are normal in B_4. The goal of this paper is to describe the action of GT-shadows on Grothendieck's child's drawings and show that this action agrees with that of $\widehat{GT}$. We discuss the hierarchy of orbits of child's drawings with respect to the actions of GTSh, $\widehat{GT}$, and the absolute Galois group G_Q of rationals. We prove that the monodromy group and the passport of a child's drawing are invariant with respect to the action of the subgroupoid of charming GT-shadows. We use the action of GT-shadows on child's drawings to prove that every Abelian child's drawing admits a Belyi pair defined over rationals. Finally, we describe selected examples of non-Abelian child's drawings.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a field with a discrete valuation, and let $p$ be a prime. It is known that if $\Gamma \lhd \Gamma_0 < \mathrm{PGL}_2(K)$ is a Schottky group normally contained in a larger group which is generated by order-$p$ elements each fixing $2$ points $a_i, b_i \in \mathbb{P}_K^1$, then the quotient of a certain subset of the projective line $\mathbb{P}_K^1$ by the action of $\Gamma$ can be algebraized as a superelliptic curve $C : y^p = f(x) / K$. The subset $S \subset K \cup \{\infty\}$ consisting of these pairs $a_i, b_i$ of fixed points is mapped modulo $\Gamma$ to the set of branch points of the superelliptic map $x : C \to \mathbb{P}_K^1$. We produce an algorithm for determining whether an input even-cardinality subset $S \subset K \cup \{\infty\}$ consists of fixed points of generators of such a group $\Gamma_0$ and which, in the case of a positive answer, modifies $S$ into a subset $S^{\mathrm{min}} \subset K \cup \{\infty\}$ with particularly nice properties. Our results do not involve any restrictions on the prime $p$ or on the residue characteristic of $K$ and allow these to be the same.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$, and let $\mathbf{G}$ denote a split, connected reductive group over $\mathcal{O}_F$. We fix a Borel subgroup $\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{T}\mathbf{U}$ with maximal torus $\mathbf{T}$ and unipotent radical $\mathbf{U}$, and let $L(\lambda)$ denote an irreducible representation of $G_0 := \mathbf{G}(\mathcal{O}_F)$ with coefficients in a sufficiently large field of characteristic $p$. Set $G := \mathbf{G}(F)$, etc.
  Assuming $\lambda$ is a $p$-small and sufficiently regular character and that $p - 1$ is greater than the Coxeter number of $\mathbf{G}$, we show that the complex $L(U,\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda)))$ splits as the orthogonal direct sum of its cohomology objects in the derived category of smooth $T$-representations in characteristic $p$. (Here $L(U, -)$ denotes Heyer's left adjoint of parabolic induction, from the derived category of smooth $G$-representations to the derived category of smooth $T$-representations.) Consequently, this gives rise to a collection of morphisms of graded spherical Hecke algebras $$\displaystyle{\bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\textrm{Ext}_{G}^{i}\left(\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda)),~\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda))\right) \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\textrm{Ext}_{T}^{i}\left(\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\lambda))),~\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\lambda)))\right)}$$ indexed by $n=-[F:\mathbb{Q}_p]\dim(\mathbf{U}), \ldots, 0$, which we refer to as derived Satake morphisms. For $\lambda=0$ and $n=0$, this recovers the graded mod $p$ Satake homomorphism constructed by Ronchetti.
  We also give some partial results for general standard parabolic subgroups $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{M}\mathbf{N} \subset \mathbf{G}$.]]></summary>

Abstract: We consider translational integer tilings by finite sets $A\subset\mathbb{Z}$. We introduce a new method based on \emph{splitting}, together with a new combinatorial interpretation of some of the main tools from our earlier work. We also use splitting to prove the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture for a new class of tilings $A\oplus B=\mathbb{Z}_M$. This includes tilings of period $M=p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}p_3^{n_3}$ with $p_1>p_2^{n_2-1}p_3^{n_3-1}$, and tilings of period $M=p_1^{n_1}p_2^2p_3^2p_4^2$ with $p_1>p_2p_3p_4$, where $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$ are distinct primes and $n_1,n_2,n_3\in\mathbb{N}$.
  This is the second one of the two papers replacing version 1 of arXiv:2207.11809 (the first one is available as arXiv:2207.11809 v2). The main results of this paper (Theorem 1.2, Corollaries 1.4 and 1.5) and the intermediate results in Section 4.2 are all new and did not appear previously in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 or anywhere else. The material in Sections 3, 4.1, and 5 (splitting and the splitting formulation of the slab reduction) did appear in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 and has been removed from arXiv:2207.11809 v2. The results in Section 7 were included in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 and have been removed from arXiv:2207.11809 v2; the proofs are shorter and (we hope) more readable.]]></summary>

Abstract: We give a new construction of tensor product gamma factors for a pair of irreducible representations of $\operatorname{GL}_c\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)$ and $\operatorname{GL}_k\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)$. This construction is a finite field analog of a construction of doubling type due to Kaplan in the local field case and due to Ginzburg in the global case, and it only assumes that one of the representations in question is generic. We use this construction to establish a relation between special values of Bessel functions attached to Speh representations and exotic matrix Kloosterman sums. Using this relation, we establish various identities, including the multiplicativity identity of exotic matrix Kloosterman sums.]]></summary>

Abstract: We generalize the classical construction of basis for the space of Eisenstein series on a principal congruence subgroup to provide a basis for the space of Eisenstein series attached to an arbitrary congruence subgroup of $\text{Sl}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. The basis elements possess a natural parameterization by the cusps and admit an explicit description using Eisenstein series on a principal level contained in the congruence subgroup. The main tool for the construction is an equivalent formulation of the regular cusps in terms of orbits in the mod $N$ lattice that addresses the sign problem intrinsic to the series of odd weights. Our arguments also yield an elementary proof of the dimension formula for the spaces of Eisenstein series of weight $\geq 3$. We use our construction to devise a simple algorithm that allows us to determine a computable basis with algebraic Fourier coefficients for a general congruence subgroup.]]></summary>

Abstract: Special kinds of continued fractions have been proved to converge to transcendental real numbers by means of the celebrated Subspace Theorem. In this paper we study the analogous $p$--adic problem. More specifically, we deal with Browkin $p$--adic continued fractions. First we give some new remarks about the Browkin algorithm in terms of a $p$--adic Euclidean algorithm. Then, we focus on the heights of some $p$--adic numbers having a periodic $p$--adic continued fraction expansion and we obtain some upper bounds. Finally, we exploit these results, together with $p$--adic Roth-like results, in order to prove the transcendence of two families of $p$--adic continued fractions.]]></summary>

Abstract: We study the low-lying zeros of a family of $L$-functions attached to the CM elliptic curves $E_d \;:\; y^2 = x^3 - dx$, for each odd and square-free integer $d$. Writing the $L$-function of $E_d$ as $L(s-\frac12, \xi_d)$ for the appropriate Gr\"ossencharakter $\xi_d$ of conductor $\mathfrak{f}_d$, the family $\mathcal{F}_d$ is defined as the family of $L$-functions attached to the Gr\"ossencharakters $\xi_{d,k}$, where for each integer $k \geq 1$, $\xi_{d, k}$ denotes the primitive character inducing $\xi_d^k$. We observe that $25\%$ of the functions in $\mathcal{F}_d$ have negative root number. This makes the symmetry type of the family (unitary, symplectic or orthogonal) somewhat mysterious, as none of the symmetry types would lead to this proportion. We give an asymptotic expression for the one-level density in the family of $L$-functions in $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ with conductor at most $K^2 \mathrm{N} (\mathfrak{f}_d)$, and find that $\mathcal{F}_d$ breaks down into two natural subfamilies; namely, a symplectic family ($L(s, \xi_{d,k})$ for $k$ even) and an orthogonal family ($L(s, \xi_{d,k})$ for $k$ odd). For $k$ odd, $\mathcal{F}_d$ is in fact a subfamily of the automorphic forms of fixed level $4 \mathrm{N} (\mathfrak{f}_d )$, and even weight $k+1$, and this larger family also has orthogonal symmetry. Finally, we compute explicit lower order terms in decreasing powers of $\log (K^2 \mathrm{N} (\mathfrak{f}_d) )$ for each case.]]></summary>

Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a field with a discrete valuation, and let $p$ be a prime. It is known that if $\Gamma \lhd \Gamma_0 < \mathrm{PGL}_2(K)$ is a Schottky group normally contained in a larger group which is generated by order-$p$ elements each fixing $2$ points $a_i, b_i \in \mathbb{P}_K^1$, then the quotient of a certain subset of the projective line $\mathbb{P}_K^1$ by the action of $\Gamma$ can be algebraized as a superelliptic curve $C : y^p = f(x) / K$. The subset $S \subset K \cup \{\infty\}$ consisting of these pairs $a_i, b_i$ of fixed points is mapped bijectively modulo $\Gamma$ to the set $\mathcal{B}$ of branch points of the superelliptic map $x : C \to \mathbb{P}_K^1$. A conjecture of Gerritzen and van der Put, in the case that $C$ is hyperelliptic and $K$ has residue characteristic $\neq 2$, compares the cluster data of $S$ with that of $\mathcal{B}$. We show that this conjecture requires a slight modification in order to hold and then prove a much stronger version of the modified conjecture that holds for any $p$ and any residue characteristic.]]></summary>

Abstract: We produce an explicit sequence $\left(S_a \right)_{a \geq 1}$ of abelian surfaces over the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_{q}(t)$ whose Tate-Shafarevich groups are finite and large. More precisely, we establish the estimate $\left \arrowvert\mathrm{III}(S_a) \right \arrowvert = H(S_a)^{1 + o(1)}$ as $a \rightarrow \infty$, where $H(S_a)$ denotes the exponential height of $S_a$. Our method is to prove that each $S_a$ satisfies the BSD conjecture, analyse the geometry and arithmetic of its N\'eron model and give an explicit expression for its $L$-function in terms of Gauss and Kloosterman sums. By studying the relative distribution of the angles associated to these character sums, we estimate the size of the central value of $L(S_a, T)$, hence the order of $\mathrm{III}(S_a)$.]]></summary>

Abstract: For $m \geq 1$, let $N \geq 1$ be coprime to $m$, $k \geq 2$, and $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character modulo $N$ with $\chi(-1)=(-1)^k$. Then let $T_m^{\text{new}}(N,k,\chi)$ denote the restriction of the $m$-th Hecke operator to the space $S_k^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N), \chi)$. We demonstrate that for fixed $m$ and trivial character $\chi$, the second coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of $T_m^{\text{new}}(N,k)$ vanishes for only finitely many pairs $(N,k)$, and we further determine the sign. To demonstrate our method, for $m=2,4$, we also compute all pairs $(N,k)$ for which the second coefficient vanishes. In the general character case, we also show that excluding an infinite family where $S_k^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N), \chi)$ is trivial, the second coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of $T_m^{\text{new}}(N,k,\chi)$ vanishes for only finitely many triples $(N,k,\chi)$.]]></summary>

Abstract: Dual lattice is an important concept of Euclidean lattices. In 2024, Deng gave the definition to the concept of the dual lattice of a $p$-adic lattice from the duality theory of locally compact abelian groups. He also proved some important properties of the dual lattice of $p$-adic lattices, which can be viewed as $p$-adic analogues of the famous Minkowski's first, second theorems and transference theorems for Euclidean lattices. However, he only proved the lower bounds of the transference theorems and Minkowski's second theorem for $p$-adic lattices. The upper bounds are left as an open question. In this paper, we prove the upper bounds of the transference theorems and Minkowski's second theorem for $p$-adic lattices. We then prove that the dual basis of an orthogonal basis is also an orthogonal basis with respect to the maximum norm.]]></summary>

Abstract: We consider finite sets $A\subset\mathbb{Z}$ tiles the integers by translations. By periodicity, any such tiling is equivalent to a factorization $A\oplus B=\mathbb{Z}_M$ of a finite cyclic group. Building on por previous work, we prove that a tentative characterization of finite tiles proposed by Coven and Meyerowitz holds for all integer tilings of period $M=(p_ip_jp_k)^2$, where $p_i,p_j,p_k$ are distinct primes. This extends the main result of [15] (Invent. Math. 2023), where we assumed that $M$ is odd. We also improve parts of the argument from [15].
  We have split the earlier (70-page) version into two papers. The current version (49 pages) is the first of the two. The main result is the same as in the previous version: we prove (T2) in the 3-prime even case. The second paper will be posted shortly as a new submission. It will have a new main result where we prove (T2) for a new class of tilings (proved very recently, not included in v1 of this paper). Splitting-related results from the earlier 70-page version of this paper have been moved there.]]></summary>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of algebraic families of maps on $\mathbb{P}^N$, over the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers, and the geometry of their preperiodic points. The goal of this note is to formulate a conjectural characterization of the subvarieties of $S \times\mathbb{P}^N$ containing a Zariski-dense set of preperiodic points, where the parameter space $S$ is a quasiprojective complex algebraic variety; the characterization is given in terms of the non-vanishing of a power of the invariant Green current associated to the family of maps. This conjectural characterization is inspired by and generalizes the Relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture for families of abelian varieties, recently proved by Gao and Habegger, and it includes as special cases the Manin-Mumford Conjecture (theorem of Raynaud) and the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture (posed by Ghioca, Tucker, and Zhang). We provide examples where the equivalence is known to hold, and we show that several recent results can be viewed as special cases. Finally, we give the proof of one implication in the conjectural characterization.]]></summary>

Abstract: Elliott and Halberstam proved that $\sum_{p<n} 2^{\omega(n-p)}$ is asymptotic to $\phi(n)$. In analogy to the Erd\H{o}s--Kac Theorem, Elliott conjectured that if one restricts the summation to primes $p$ such that $\omega(n-p)\le 2 \log \log n+\lambda(2\log \log n)^{1/2}$ then the sum will be asymptotic to $\phi(n)\int_{-\infty}^{\lambda} e^{-t^2/2}dt/\sqrt{2\pi}$. We show that this conjecture follows from the Bombieri--Vinogradov Theorem. We further prove a related result involving Poisson--Dirichlet distribution, employing deeper lying level of distribution results of the primes.]]></summary>

Abstract: It follows from the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula that the rank of an abelian variety (with trivial trace) defined over the function field of a curve is bounded by a quantity which depends on the genus of the base curve and on bad reduction data. Using a function field version of classical $\ell$-descent techniques, we derive an arithmetic refinement of this bound, extending previous work of the second and third authors from elliptic curves to abelian varieties, and improving on their result in the case of elliptic curves. When the abelian variety is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, we produce a more explicit $2$-descent map. Then we apply this machinery to studying points on the Jacobians of certain genus $2$ curves over $k(t)$, where $k$ is some perfect base field of characteristic not $2$.]]></summary>

Abstract: A central question in Arithmetic geometry is to determine for which polynomials $f \in \mathbb{Z}[t]$ and which number fields $K$ the Hasse principle holds for the affine equation $f(t) = N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\boldsymbol{x}) \neq 0$. Whilst extensively studied in the literature, current results are largely limited to polynomials and number fields of low degree. In this paper, we establish the Hasse principle for a wide family of polynomials and number fields, including polynomials that are products of arbitrarily many linear, quadratic or cubic factors. The proof generalises an argument of Irving, which makes use of the beta sieve of Rosser and Iwaniec. As a further application of our sieve results, we prove new cases of a conjecture of Harpaz and Wittenberg on locally split values of polynomials over number fields, and discuss consequences for rational points in fibrations.]]></summary>

Abstract: A rational face cuboid is a cuboid that all of edges, two of three face diagonals and space diagonal have rational lengths. \[ E_{1,s}: y^2=x(x-(2s)^2)(x+(s^2-1)^2) \] for a rational number $s \neq 0, \pm 1$, and define $\tilde{A}$ consisting of all pairs of a rational number $s$ and a non-torsion rational point $(\alpha, \beta ) \in E_{1,s}(\mathbb{Q})$. We construct a surjective map from $\tilde{A}$ to the set $\mathscr{F}$ of equivalence classes of rational face cuboids, and prove that this map is a $32:1$-map. In this way, we show that the set $\mathscr{F}$ has infinite elements. Also, we prove that there are infinitely many $s \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{ 0,\pm 1 \}$ with $\mathrm{rank} E_{1,s} (\mathbb{Q})>0$. In this proof, we construct pairs of $s$ and $(\alpha, \beta) \in E_{1,s} (\mathbb{Q})$ which are not parametric solutions.]]></summary>

In such a case the corresponding Euler constant can be expressed in terms of the Euler constants $\gamma(d,a)$ of the series $\zeta_{\,d,a}(s)$ involved and the (numerically more harmless) term $H'(1)/H(1)$.

Abstract: Many generating series of combinatorially interesting numbers have the property that the sum of the terms of order $<p$ at some suitable point is congruent to a zero of a zeta-function modulo infinitely many primes $p$. Surprisingly, very often these congruences turn out to hold modulo $p^2$ or even $p^3$. We call such congruences supercongruences and in the past 15 years an abundance of them have been discovered. In this paper we show that a large proportion of them can be explained by the use of modular functions and forms.]]></summary>

Abstract: The Euler--Kronecker constant of a number field $K$ is the ratio of the constant and the residue of the Laurent series of the Dedekind zeta function $\zeta_K(s)$ at $s=1$. We study the distribution of the Euler--Kronecker constant $\gamma_q^+$ of the maximal real subfield of $\mathbb Q(\zeta_q)$ as $q$ ranges over the primes. Further, we consider the distribution of $\gamma_q^+-\gamma_q$, with $\gamma_q$ the Euler--Kronecker constant of $\mathbb Q(\zeta_q)$ and show how it is connected with Kummer's conjecture, which predicts the asymptotic growth of the relative class number of $\mathbb Q(\zeta_q)$. We improve, for example, the known results on the bounds on average for the Kummer ratio and we prove analogous sharp bounds for $\gamma_q^+-\gamma_q$. The methods employed are partly inspired by those used by Granville (1990) and Croot and Granville (2002) to investigate Kummer's conjecture. We supplement our theoretical findings with numerical illustrations to reinforce our conclusions.]]></summary>

A polynomial $f \in \mathbb Q[X]$ is said to be integral-valued on $S$ if $f(s) \in \overline{\mathbb Z}$ for all $s \in S$. The set $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z})$ of all integral-valued polynomials on $S$ forms a subring of $\mathbb Q[X]$ containing $\mathbb Z[X]$. We say that $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z})$ is trivial if $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z}) = \mathbb Z[X]$, and nontrivial otherwise. We give a collection of necessary and sufficient conditions on $S$ in order $\text{Int}_{\mathbb Q}(S,\overline{\mathbb Z})$ to be nontrivial. Our characterizations involve, variously, topological conditions on $S$ with respect to fixed extensions of the $p$-adic valuations to $\overline{\mathbb Q}$; pseudo-monotone sequences contained in $S$; ramification indices and residue field degrees; and the polynomial closure of $S$ in $\overline{\mathbb Z}$.]]></summary>

Abstract: The Lagrange and Markov spectra have been studied since late 19th century, concerning badly approximable real numbers. The Mordell-Gruber spectrum has been studied since 1936, concerning the supremum of the area of a rectangle centered at the origin that contains no other points of a unimodular lattice. We develop techniques that incorporate unimodular lattices and integer sequences, providing the log-systole function which unifies four famous spectra. We compute the Mordell-Gruber spectrum in the two-dimensional case and generalize Perron's formulas behind some famous spectra. Furthermore, we generalize the sum of Cantor sets to prove that certain functions on cartesian product of two Cantor sets contain an interval. Combining the techniques, we prove closedness and existence of Hall's interval in several different applications.]]></summary>

Abstract: Sharp restriction theory and the finite field extension problem have both received a great deal of attention in the last two decades, but so far they have not intersected. In this paper, we initiate the study of sharp restriction theory on finite fields. We prove that constant functions maximize the Fourier extension inequality from the parabola $\mathbb{P}^1\subset \mathbb{F}^{2\ast}_q$ and the paraboloid $\mathbb{P}^2\subset \mathbb{F}_q^{3\ast}$ at the euclidean Stein-Tomas endpoint; here, $\mathbb{F}_q^{d\ast}$ denotes the (dual) $d$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb F_q$ with $q=p^n$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number greater than $3$ or $2$, respectively. We fully characterize the maximizers for the $L^2\to L^4$ extension inequality from $\mathbb{P}^2$ whenever $q\equiv 1(\text{mod}\, 4)$. Our methods lead to analogous results on the hyperbolic paraboloid, whose corresponding euclidean problem remains open. We further establish that constants maximize the $L^2\to L^4$ extension inequality from the cone $\Gamma^3:=\{(\boldsymbol{\xi},\tau, \sigma)\in \mathbb{F}^{4\ast}_q: \tau\sigma=\boldsymbol{\xi}^2\}\setminus \{{\bf 0}\}$ whenever $q\equiv 3(\text{mod}\, 4)$. By contrast, we prove that constant functions fail to be critical points for the corresponding inequality on $\Gamma^3\cup \{{\bf 0}\}$ over $\mathbb{F}_p^4$. While some inspiration is drawn from the euclidean setting, entirely new phenomena emerge which are related to the underlying arithmetic and discrete structures.]]></summary>

In this paper, we explore many further properties and extensions of these.

We further explore the MacMahon-like functions and discover new and suggestive arithmetic structure and modular completions.]]></summary>

Abstract: We address partition regularity problems for homogeneous quadratic equations. A consequence of our main results is that, under natural conditions on the coefficients $a,b,c$, for any finite coloring of the positive integers, there exists a solution to $ax^2+by^2=cz^2$ where $x$ and $y$ have the same color (and similar results for $x,z$ and $y,z$). For certain choices of $(a,b,c)$, our result is conditional on an Elliott-type conjecture. Our proofs build on and extend previous arguments of the authors dealing with the Pythagorean equation. We make use of new uniformity properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions and concentration estimates for multiplicative functions along arbitrary binary quadratic forms.]]></summary>

Abstract: Consider $N \geq 1$, $k \geq 2$, and $\chi$ a Dirichlet character modulo $N$ such that $\chi(-1) = (-1)^k$. For any bound $B$, one can show that $\dim S_k(\Gamma_0(N),\chi) \le B$ for only finitely many triples $(N,k,\chi)$. It turns out that this property does not extend to the newspace; there exists an infinite family of triples $(N,k,\chi)$ for which $\dim S_k^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi) = 0$. However, we classify this case entirely. We also show that excluding the infinite family for which $\dim S_k^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi) = 0$, $\dim S_k^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi) \leq B$ for only finitely many triples $(N,k,\chi)$. In order to show these results, we derive an explicit dimension formula for the newspace $S_k^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)$. We also use this explicit dimension formula to prove a character equidistribution property and disprove a conjecture from Greg Martin that $\dim S_2^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N))$ takes on all possible non-negative integers.]]></summary>

Abstract: In his ``lost notebook'', Ramanujan used iterated derivatives of two theta functions to define sequences of $q$-series $\{U_{2t}(q)\}$ and $\{V_{2t}(q)\}$ that he claimed to be quasimodular. We give the first explicit proof of this claim by expressing them in terms of ``partition Eisenstein series'', extensions of the classical Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(q)$ defined by $$\lambda=(1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2},\dots, n^{m_n}) \vdash n \ \ \ \ \ \longmapsto \ \ \ \ \ E_{\lambda}(q):= E_2(q)^{m_1} E_4(q)^{m_2}\cdots E_{2n}(q)^{m_n}. $$ For functions $\phi : \mathcal{P}\mapsto \C$ on partitions, the {\it weight $2n$ partition Eisenstein trace} is $$ \Tr_n(\phi;q):=\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \phi(\lambda)E_{\lambda}(q). $$ For all $t$, we prove that $U_{2t}(q)=\Tr_t(\phi_u;q)$ and $V_{2t}(q)=\Tr_t(\phi_v;q),$ where $\phi_u$ and $\phi_v$ are natural partition weights, giving the first explicit quasimodular formulas for these series.]]></summary>

Abstract: For $k\geq 0$, a $k$-generalized Markov number is an integer which appears in some positive integer solution to the $k$-generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(yz + zx + xy) = (3 + 3k)xyz$. In this paper, we discuss a combinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this structure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn matrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show that these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric interpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov numbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical Markov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint. Moreover, we clarify a relation between $k$-generalized Markov numbers and toric surface singularities via continued fractions.]]></summary>

Firstly, we show that as the level varies over all $p$-powers, the graphs form an Iwasawa-theoretic abelian $p$-tower, which can be regarded as a graph-theoretical analogue of the Igusa tower of modular curves. Secondly, we study the structure of the crater of these graphs, generalizing previous results on volcano graphs. Finally, we solve an inverse problem of graphs arising from the crater of $l$-isogeny graphs with level structures, partially generalizing a recent result of Bambury, Campagna and Pazuki.]]></summary>

We shall denote by $K^m/K$ the maximal $m$-step solvable extension of $K$, and write $G_K^{m}$ for the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the absolute Galois group $G_K$ of $K$; we will regard $G_K$ and its quotients as filtered profinite groups, by equipping those with the corresponding ramification filtrations (in upper numbering). It is known from the previous result due to Mochizuki that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the filtered profinite group $G_K$. In this paper, we prove (with some mono-anabelian results) that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the maximal metabelian quotient $G_K^2$ as a filtered profinite group, and further that $K^{m}/K$ is determined functorially by the filtered profinite group $G_{K}^{m+2}$ (resp. $G_{K}^{m+3}$) for $m\geq 2$ (resp. $m\leq 1$).]]></summary>

This simultaneously generalizes a result of Shkredov about corner-free sets and a recent result of Peluse, Sah, and Sawhney about sets without $3$-term arithmetic progressions of common difference $z^2-1$.

Abstract: Working over a base number field $\KK$, we study the attractive question of Zariski non-density for $(D,S)$-integral points in $\mathrm{O}_f(x)$ the forward $f$-orbit of a rational point $x \in X(\KK)$. Here, $f \colon X \rightarrow X$ is a regular surjective self-map for $X$ a geometrically irreducible projective variety over $\KK$. Given a non-zero and effective $f$-quasi-polarizable Cartier divisor $D$ on $X$ and defined over $\KK$, our main result gives a sufficient condition, that is formulated in terms of the $f$-dynamics of $D$, for non-Zariski density of certain dynamically defined subsets of $\mathrm{O}_f(x)$. For the case of $(D,S)$-integral points, this result gives a sufficient condition for non-Zariski density of integral points in $\mathrm{O}_f(x)$. Our approach expands on that of Yasufuku, \cite{Yasufuku:2015}, building on earlier work of Silverman \cite{Silverman:1993}. Our main result gives an unconditional form of the main results of loc.~cit.; the key arithmetic input to our main theorem is the Subspace Theorem of Schmidt in the generalized form that has been given by Ru and Vojta in \cite{Ru:Vojta:2016} and expanded upon in \cite{Grieve:points:bounded:degree} and \cite{Grieve:qualitative:subspace}.]]></summary>

In addition, we prove an effective ``popular'' version of this result, showing that every dense set has some non-zero $d$ such that the number of configurations with difference parameter $d$ is almost optimal.

Equivalently, this is the number of $\mathbf{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ conjugacy classes in $\mathbf{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of trace $d-1$. We conjecture the equality extends to all $d \geq 4$. We prove that this conjecture implies more that one equivalence class of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs for every $d > 22$.
  Additionally, we refine the "class field hypothesis" of Appleby, Flammia, McConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field generated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SIC. The class fields conjecturally associated to SICs in dimension $d$ come with a natural partial order under inclusion; we show that the natural inclusions of these fields are strict, except in a small family of cases.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $S_1=\{p_1,p_2,\cdots, p_l\}\subset\cc[z_1,z_2\cdots,z_n]$ be a set of quadratic forms such that $p_i=q_i^2$ where $\{q_i\}_{i=1}^l$ are linear forms. For $1\leq k\leq l$, let $S_k=\{p_{i_1}p_{i_2}\cdots p_{i_k}|1\leq i_1<i_2<\cdots<i_k\leq l\}$ be the set of $k$-products of distinct polynomials in $S_1$. We show somehow unexpectedly that linear independence of $S_1$ is equivalent to that of $S_k$ for $k=2$ and $3$ under certain rank conditions. Among technical treatments in the proof, of independent conceptual interest is a novel polynomial identity which elegantly incorporates quadratic forms and matrix determinants.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $M$ be an uniformizable Anderson t-motive and $L(M)$ its lattice.

Second, we show that some lattices which do not belong to the set $L(M)$ of pure $M$, are lattices of non-pure $M$. This is a result towards surjectivity of the lattice map. The t-motives used in the proofs are non-pure t-motives of dimension 2, rank 3.]]></summary>

Abstract: For a variety over a global field, one can consider subsets of the set of adelic points of the variety cut out by finite abelian descent or Brauer-Manin obstructions. Given a Galois extension of the ground field one can consider similar sets over the extension and take Galois invariants. In this paper, we study under which circumstances the Galois invariants recover the obstruction sets over the ground field. As an application of our results, we study finite abelian descent and Brauer-Manin obstructions for isotrivial curves over function fields and extend results obtained by the first and last authors for constant curves to the isotrivial case.]]></summary>

Moreover, using the same ideas we negatively answer another irrationality question, posed by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Ronald Graham.

Abstract: We call an order $O$ in a quadratic field $K$ odd (resp. even) if its discriminant is an odd (resp. even) integer. We call an elliptic curve $E$ over the field $C$ of complex numbers with CM odd (resp. even) if its endomorphism ring $End(E)$ is an odd (resp. even) order in the corresponding imaginary quadratic field.
  Suppose that $j(E)$ is a real number and let us consider the set $J(R,E)$ of all $j(E')$ where $E'$ is any elliptic curve that enjoys the following properties.
  1) $E'$ is isogenous to $E$;
  2) $j(E')$ is a real number;
  3) $E'$ has the same parity as $E$.
  We prove that the closure of $J(R,E)$ in the set $R$ of real numbers is the closed semi-infinite interval $(-\infty,1728]$ (resp. the whole $R$) if $E$ is odd (resp. even).
  This paper was inspired by a question of Jean-Louis Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Alena Pirutka about the distribution of $j$-invariants of certain elliptic curves of CM type.]]></summary>

Abstract: We show that integer partitions, the fundamental building blocks in additive number theory, detect prime numbers in an unexpected way. Answering a question of Schneider, we show that the primes are the solutions to special equations in partition functions. For example, an integer $n\geq 2$ is prime if and only if
  $$
  (3n^3 - 13n^2 + 18n - 8)M_1(n) + (12n^2 - 120n + 212)M_2(n) -960M_3(n) = 0,
  $$
  where the $M_a(n)$ are MacMahon's well-studied partition functions. More generally, for "MacMahonesque" partition functions $M_{\vec{a}}(n),$ we prove that there are infinitely many such prime detecting equations with constant coefficients, such as
  $$
  80M_{(1,1,1)}(n)-12M_{(2,0,1)}(n)+12M_{(2,1,0)}(n)+\dots-12M_{(1,3)}(n)-39M_{(3,1)}(n)=0.

Abstract: We consider small solutions of quadratic congruences of the form $x_1^2+\alpha_2x_2^2+\alpha_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q}$, where $q=p^m$ is an odd prime power. Here, $\alpha_2$ is arbitrary but fixed and $\alpha_3$ is variable, and we assume that $(\alpha_2\alpha_3,p)=1$. We show that for all $\alpha_3$ modulo $p^m$ which are coprime to $p$ except for a small number of $\alpha_3$'s, an asymptotic formula for the number of solutions $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ to the congruence $x_1^2+\alpha_2x_2^2+\alpha_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q}$ with $\max\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|\}\le N$ holds if $N\ge q^{11/24+\varepsilon}$ and $q$ is large enough. It is of significance that we break the barrier 1/2 in the above exponent. If $q$ is restricted to powers of a fixed prime $p$, we obtain a slight improvement of this result using the theory of $p$-adic exponent pairs, as developed by Mili\'cevi\'c, replacing the exponent $11/24$ above by $11/25$. Under the Lindel\"of hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions, we are able to replace the exponent $11/24$ above by $1/3$.]]></summary>

The formula expresses these values in terms of modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials evaluated at the Satake parameter attached to the representation. Our proof is combinatorial and very simple. It utilizes Macdonald's formula and the unramified computation of the Ginzburg-Kaplan integral. This addresses a question of Lapid-Mao.]]></summary>

This confirms a conjecture by the first author. As a byproduct of our proof, we studied the correlation between $\Delta(x)$ and $\Delta(\theta x)$, where $\theta$ is a fixed real number. We prove that there is a non-trivial correlation when $\theta$ is rational, and a decorrelation when $\theta$ is irrational. Moreover, if $\theta$ has a finite irrationality measure, then we can make it quantitative this decorrelation in terms of this measure.]]></summary>

This answers a question in the paper of Miyazaki and Pink [T. Miyazaki and I. Pink, Number of solutions to a special type of unit equations in two unknowns, III, arXiv:2403.20037].]]></summary>

Abstract: In this paper we show for every sufficiently large integer $g$ the existence of a complete family of closed and embedded constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces deforming the Lawson surfaces $\xi_{1,g}$ parametrized by their conformal type. When specializing to the minimal case, we discover a pattern resulting in the coefficients of the involved expansions being alternating multiple zeta values (MZVs), which generalizes the notion of Riemann's zeta values to multiple integer variables. This allows us to extend a new existence proof of the Lawson surfaces $\xi_{1,g}$ for all to all $g\geq 3$ using complex analytic methods and to give closed form expressions of their area expansion up to order $7$. For example, the third order coefficient is $\tfrac{9}{4}\zeta(3)$ (the first and second order term were shown to be $\log(2)$ and $0$ respectively in \cite{HHT}). As a corollary, we obtain that the area of $\xi_{1,g}$ is monotonically increasing in their genus $g$ for all $g\geq 0.$]]></summary>

Abstract: It is well known that Ramanujan conjectured congruences modulo powers of $5$, $7$ and and $11$ for the partition function. These were subsequently proved by Watson (1938) and Atkin (1967). In 2009 Choi, Kang, and Lovejoy proved congruences modulo powers of $5$ for the crank parity function. The generating function for the analogous rank parity function is $f(q)$, the first example of a mock theta function that Ramanujan mentioned in his last letter to Hardy. Recently we proved congruences modulo powers of $5$ for the rank parity function, and here we extend these congruences for powers of $7$. We also show how these congruences imply congruences modulo powers of $5$ and $7$ for the coefficients of the related third order mock theta function $\omega(q)$, using Atkin-Lehner involutions and transformation results of Zwegers. Finally we a prove a family of congruences modulo powers of $7$ for the crank parity function.]]></summary>

Abstract: We develop a new approach to the isospectrality of the orbifolds constructed by Vign\'eras. We give fine sufficient criteria for i-isospectrality in given degree i and for representation equivalence. These allow us to produce very small exotic examples of isospectral orbifolds: hyperbolic 3-orbifolds that are i-isospectral for all i but not representation equivalent, hyperbolic 3-orbifolds that are 0-isospectral but not 1-isospectral, and others. Using the same method, we also give sufficient criteria for rationality of regulator quotients Reg_i(Y_1)^2/Reg_i(Y_2)^2 for Vign\'eras orbifolds Y_1, Y_2, sometimes even when they are not isospectral. Moreover, we establish a link between the primes that enter in these regulator quotients and at which torsion homology of Y_1 and Y_2 can differ, and Galois representations.]]></summary>

Abstract: We prove Chai's conjecture on the additivity of the base change conductor of semiabelian varieties in the case of Jacobians of proper curves. This includes the first infinite family of non-trivial wildly ramified examples. Along the way, we extend Raynaud's construction of the N\'eron lft-model of a Jacobian in terms of the Picard functor to arbitrary seminormal curves (beyond which Jacobians admit no N\'eron lft-models, as shown by our more general structural results). Finally, we investigate the structure of Jacobians of (not necessarily geometrically reduced) proper curves over fields of degree of imperfection at most one and prove two conjectures about the existence of N\'eron models and N\'eron lft-models due to Bosch-L\"utkebohmert-Raynaud for Jacobians of general proper curves in the case of perfect residue fields, thus strengthening the author's previous results in this situation.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$. For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, we denote by $\omega_a^*(n)$ the number of shifted-prime divisors $p-a$ of $n$, where $p>a$ is prime. In this paper, we study the moments of $\omega_a^*$ over shifted primes $p-b$. Specifically, we prove an asymptotic formula for the first moment and upper and lower bounds of the correct order of magnitude for the second moment. These results suggest that the average behavior of $\omega^*_a$ on shifted primes is similar to its average behavior on natural numbers. We shall also prove upper bounds for the mean values of sub-multiplicative functions in a nice class over the least common multiples of the shifted primes $p-a$ and $q-b$. Such upper bounds are intimately related to the second moments of $\omega^*_a$ over natural numbers and over shifted primes. Finally, we propose a new conjecture on the second moment of $\omega_1^*$ over natural numbers and provide a heuristic argument in support of this conjecture.]]></summary>

Abstract: For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi, n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\, \colon\ H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this operation has many functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus, the pointed set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and our new operation coincides with the usual power operation $(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^n$.
  For a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$, and the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite separable extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. We show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$, but they need not be equal. However, ${\rm per}(\xi)$ and ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ have the same set of prime factors.]]></summary>

We consider such sets in the setting of sigma-compact locally compact Abelian groups and show that the topological entropy of the associated Delone dynamical system is zero. For this we provide a suitable version of the variational principle. We furthermore construct counterexamples, which show that the patch counting entropy of such sets can be non-zero in this context.

Abstract: In 2012 Paule and Radu proved a difficult family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for Andrews' 2-colored generalized Frobenius partition function. The family is associated with the classical modular curve of level 20. We demonstrate the existence of a congruence family for a related generalized Frobenius partition function associated with the same curve. We construct an isomorphism between this new family and the original family of congruences via a mapping on the associated rings of modular functions. The pairing of the congruence families provides a new strategy for future work on congruences associated with modular curves of composite level. We show how a similar approach can be made to multiple other recent examples in the literature. We also give some important insights into the behavior of these congruence families with respect to the Atkin--Lehner involution which proved very important in Paule and Radu's original proof.]]></summary>

Abstract: The theories of hypergeometric functions and modular forms are highly intertwined. For example, particular values of truncated hypergeometric functions and hypergeometric character sums are often congruent or equal to Fourier coefficients of modular forms. In this series of papers, we develop and explore an explicit "Hypergeometric-Modularity" method for associating a modular form to a given hypergeometric datum. In particular, for certain length three and four hypergeometric data we give an explicit method for finding a modular form $f$ such that the corresponding hypergeometric Galois representation has a subrepresentation isomorphic to the Deligne representation of $f$. Our method utilizes Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions to alternative bases, commutative formal group laws, and supercongruences. As a byproduct, we give a collection of eta quotients with multiplicative coefficients constructed from hypergeometric functions. In the second paper, we discuss a number of applications, including explicit connections between hypergeometric values and periods of these explicit eta quotients as well as evaluation formulae for certain special $L$-values.]]></summary>

Abstract: For an algebraic Hecke character defined on a CM field $F$ of degree $2d$, Katz constructed a $p$-adic $L$-function of $d+1+\delta_{F,p}$ variables in his innovative paper published in 1978, where $\delta_{F,p}$ denotes the Leopoldt defect for $F$ and $p$. In the present article, we generalise the result of Katz under several technical conditions (containing the absolute unramifiedness of $F$ at $p$), and construct a $p$-adic Artin $L$-function of $d+1+\delta_{F,p}$ variables, which interpolates critical values of the Artin $L$-function associated to a $p$-unramified Artin representation of the absolute Galois group $G_F$. Our construction is an analogue over a CM field of Greenberg's construction over a totally real field, but there appear new difficulties which do not matter in Greenberg's case.]]></summary>

Abstract: We obtain a strong bound on the second moment of the $GL_3$ standard $L$-function on the critical line. The method builds on the recent work of Aggarwal, Leung, and Munshi which treated shorter intervals. We deduce some corollaries including an improvement on the error term in the Rankin-Selberg problem, and on certain subconvexity bounds for $GL_3 \times GL_2$ and $GL_3$ $L$-functions. As a byproduct of the method of proof, we also obtain an estimate for an average of shifted convolution sums of $GL_3$ Fourier coefficients.]]></summary>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, $K$ a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $n$ an integer $\geq 2$. We completely and explicitly describe the global sections of the de Rham complex of the Drinfeld space over $K$ in dimension $n-1$ as a complex of (duals of) locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$, together with a quasi-isomorphism with the direct sum of its (shifted) cohomology groups.]]></summary>
