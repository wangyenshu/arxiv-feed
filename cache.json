In particular, our $\\Omega$-results match the expected conjectural upper bounds when the denominator of the twist is sufficiently small compared to the length of the sum. Non-trivial $\\Omega$-results for sums over short segments are also obtained. Along the way we produce lower bounds for mean squares of the exponential sums in question and also improve the best known upper bound for these sums in some ranges of parameters.",

The notion of $\\mathcal{M}$-points generalizes the concepts of integral points, Campana points and Darmon points. We introduce and study $M$-approximation over number fields and function fields, which is a notion that generalizes weak and strong approximation. We show that this property implies that the set of $\\mathcal{M}$-points is not thin. We then give a simple characterisation of when a split toric varieties satisfy $M$-approximation, generalizing work of Nakahara and Streeter. Further, we determine when the set of $\\mathcal{M}$-points on a split toric variety is thin.",

In the present paper, we focus on negative continued fractions and defined left $q$-deformed negative continued fractions. We give a formula for computing the $q$-deformed Farey sum of the left $q$-deformed rational numbers based on it. We use this formula to give a combinatorial proof of the relationship between the left $q$-deformed rational number and the Jones polynomial of the corresponding rational knot which was proved by Bapat, Becker and Licata using a homological technique. Finally, we combine their work and the $q$-deformed Farey sum, and give a homological interpretation of the $q$-deformed Farey sum.

This method is significant as it generalizes the procedures for generating orthogonal matrices that fix a general fixed symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms.

Our proof combines renewal theory with the representation of score sequences as lattice paths, due to Erd\\H{o}s and Moser in the 1960s. These probabilistic and geometric points of view lead to a simpler proof. A key idea in the original proof and ours is to consider cyclic shifts of score sequences. We observe, however, that this idea is already present in Kleitman's remarks added to one of Moser's final articles in 1968, and in subsequent works by Kleitman. In the same article, Moser conjectured that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{5/2}$ many score sequences of length $n$.

In our previous paper, we investigated the compactifications of the Gaussian Deligne-Mostow variety. Here we work on the remaining case, namely the ring of Eisenstein integers, which is related to the moduli space of unordered 12 points on $\\mathbb P^1$. In particular, we show that Kirwan's partial resolution of the moduli space is not a semi-toroidal compactification and Deligne-Mostow's period map does not lift to the unique toroidal compactification. We give two interpretations of these phenomena in terms of the log minimal model program and automorphic forms. As an application, we prove that the above two compactifications are not (stacky) derived equivalent, as the $DK$-conjecture predicts. Furthermore, we construct an automorphic form on the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 4, which is isogenous to the Eisenstein Deligne-Mostow variety, giving another intrinsic proof, independent of lattice embeddings, of a result by Casalaina-Martin, Jensen and Laza.",

          "description": "arXiv:2406.19921v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the 80's Kudla and Millson introduced a theta function in two variables. It behaves as a Siegel modular form with respect to the first variable, and is a closed differential form on an orthogonal Shimura variety with respect to the other variable. We prove that the Lefschetz decomposition of the cohomology class of that theta function is also its modular decomposition in Eisenstein, Klingen and cuspidal parts. We also show that the image of the Kudla-Millson lift is contained in the primitive cohomology of X. As an application, we deduce dimension formulas for the cohomology of X in low degree. Our results cover the cases of moduli spaces of compact hyperk\\\"ahler manifolds.",

For any lacunary sequence $(a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ we prove the existence of a dilation factor $\\alpha$ such that the maximal gap is of order at most $(\\log N)/N$, and we prove that for Lebesgue almost all $\\alpha$ the maximal gap is of order at most $(\\log N)^{2+\\varepsilon}/N$. The metric result is generalized to other measures satisfying a certain Fourier decay assumption. Both upper bounds are optimal up to a factor of logarithmic order, and the latter result improves a recent result of Chow and Technau. Finally, we show that our result implies an improved upper bound in the inhomogeneous version of Littlewood's problem in multiplicative Diophantine approximation.",

We introduce a canonical height of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) which is finite precisely when the complexifications of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) are K-semistable. When the complexifications are K-polystable, the canonical height is the height of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) wrt any volume-normalized K\\\"ahler-Einstein metric on the complexifications of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) The canonical height is shown to have a number of useful variational properties. Moreover, it may be expressed as a limit of periods on the N-fold products of the complexifications of X, as N tends to infinity. In particular, using this limit formula, the canonical height for the arithmetic log surfaces (P_1,D) over the integers, where D has at most three components, is computed explicitly in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function and its derivative at s=-1. Combining this explicit formula with previous height formulas for quaternionic Shimura curves yields a procedure for extracting information about the canonical integral models of some Shimura curves, such as wild ramification. Furthermore, explicit formulas for the canonical height of twisted Fermat curves are obtained, implying explicit Parshin type bounds for the Arakelov metric.",
