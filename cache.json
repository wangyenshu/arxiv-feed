More specifically, in this paper, we consider the case of the complex dimensions of a lattice (rather than of a nonlattice) self-similar string and show that the corresponding diffraction measure exists, is unique, and is given by a suitable $\\textit{continuous}$ analogue of a discrete Dirac comb. We also obtain more general results concerning the autocorrelation measures and diffraction measures of generalized idealized fractals associated to possibly degenerate lattices and the corresponding extension of the Poisson Summation Formula.",

Previously optimal approximation exponents for lattice actions on homogeneous spaces were established under the assumption that the restriction of the automorphic representation to the stability group is suitably tempered. However, for irreducible lattices in semisimple algebraic groups, either this property does not hold or it amounts to an instance of the Ramanujan-Petersson-Selberg conjecture. Sarnak's Density Hypothesis and its variants bounding the multiplicities of irreducible representations occurring in the decomposition of the automorphic representation can be viewed as a weakening of the temperedness property. A refined form of this hypothesis has recently been established for uniform irreducible arithmetic congruence lattices arising from quaternion algebras. We employ this result in order to establish - unconditionally - an optimal approximation exponent for the actions of these lattices on the associated symmetric spaces. We also give a general spectral criterion for the optimality of the approximation exponent for irreducible uniform lattices in a product of arbitrary Gelfand pairs. Our methods involve utilizing the multiplicity bounds in the pre-trace formula, establishing refined estimates of the spherical transforms, and carrying out an elaborate spectral analysis that bounds the Hilbert-Schmidt norms of carefully balanced geometric convolution operators.",

We completely settle the most general version of the problem of convergence of these joint moments, after they are suitably rescaled, for an arbitrary number of derivatives and with arbitrary positive real exponents. Our approach relies on a hidden, higher-order exchangeable structure, that of an exchangeable array. Using these probabilistic techniques, we then give a combinatorial formula for the leading order coefficient in the asymptotics of the joint moments, when the power on the characteristic polynomial itself is a positive real number and the exponents of the derivatives are integers, in terms of a finite number of finite-dimensional integrals which are explicitly computable. Finally, we develop a method, based on a class of Hankel determinants shifted by partitions, that allows us to give an exact representation of all these joint moments, for finite matrix size, in terms of derivatives of Painlev\\'e V transcendents, and then for the leading order coefficient in the large-matrix limit in terms of derivatives of the $\\sigma$-Painlev\\'e III' equation. This gives an efficient way to compute all these moments and coefficients explicitly. Our methods can be used to obtain analogous results for a number of other models sharing the same features.",

Studying the subrepresentation of $\\Gamma$-locally analytic vectors, $W^{\\mathrm{la}}$, is useful because $W^{\\mathrm{la}}$ can be analyzed via the Lie algebra $\\mathrm{Lie}(\\Gamma)$, which simplifies the action of $\\Gamma$. Additionally, $W^{\\mathrm{la}}$ often behaves as a decompletion of $W$, making it closer to an algebraic or geometric object.\n  This article introduces a notion of locally analytic vectors for $W$ in a mixed characteristic setting, specifically for $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tate algebras. This generalization encompasses the classical definition and also specializes to super-H\\\"older vectors in characteristic $p$. Using binomial expansions instead of Taylor series, this new definition bridges locally analytic vectors in characteristic $0$ and $p$.\n  Our main theorem shows that under certain conditions, the map $W \\mapsto W^{\\mathrm{la}}$ acts as a descent, and the derived locally analytic vectors $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{la}}^i(W)$ vanish for $i \\geq 1$. This result extends Theorem C of \\cite{Po24}, providing new tools for propagating information about locally analytic vectors from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$.\n  We provide three applications: a new proof of Berger-Rozensztajn's main result using characteristic $0$ methods, the introduction of an integral multivariable ring $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}_{\\mathrm{LT}}^{\\dagger,\\mathrm{la}}$ in the Lubin-Tate setting, and a novel interpretation of the classical Cohen ring ${\\mathbf{A}}_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$ from the theory of $(\\varphi,\\Gamma)$-modules in terms of locally analytic vectors.",

In the literature, considerable efforts have been dedicated to constructing good binary sequences of various lengths. As a consequence, numerous constructions of good binary sequences have been put forward. However, the majority of known constructions leverage the multiplicative cyclic group structure of finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $p$ is a prime and $n$ is a positive integer. Recently, the authors made use of the cyclic group structure of all rational places of the rational function field over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, and firstly constructed good binary sequences of length $p^n+1$ via cyclotomic function fields over $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for any prime $p$ \\cite{HJMX24,JMX22}. This approach has paved a new way for constructing good binary sequences. Motivated by the above constructions, we exploit the cyclic group structure on rational points of elliptic curves to design a family of binary sequences of length $2^n+1+t$ with a low correlation for many given integers $|t|\\le 2^{(n+2)/2}$. Specifically, for any positive integer $d$ with $\\gcd(d,2^n+1+t)=1$, we introduce a novel family of binary sequences of length $2^n+1+t$, size $q^{d-1}-1$, correlation bounded by $(2d+1) \\cdot 2^{(n+2)/2}+ |t|$, and a large linear complexity via elliptic curves.",

We also show that the expansion constant is an algebraic integer under mild conditions. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with contradictory overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We give a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, that is, no such contradiction will emerge. We also give many one-dimensional examples of overlapping substitution.

Namely, an $H$-Galois extension $L/K$ is $H$-Kummer if $L$ can be generated by adjoining to $K$ a finite set $S$ of eigenvectors for the action of the Hopf algebra $H$ on $L$. This extends the classical Kummer condition for the classical Galois structure. With this new perspective, we shall characterize a class of $H$-Kummer extensions $L/K$ as radical extensions that are linearly disjoint with the $n$-th cyclotomic extension of $K$. This result generalizes the description of Kummer Galois extensions as radical extensions of a field containing the $n$-th roots of the unity. The main tool is the construction of a product Hopf-Galois structure on the compositum of almost classically Galois extensions $L_1/K$, $L_2/K$ such that $L_1\\cap M_2=L_2\\cap M_1=K$, where $M_i$ is a field such that $L_iM_i=\\widetilde{L}_i$, the normal closure of $L_i/K$.

It is known that Watkins's conjecture holds on average. This article investigates the conjecture over certain thin families of elliptic curves. For example, for prime $\\ell$, we quantify the elliptic curves featuring a rational $\\ell$-torsion that satisfies Watkins's conjecture.

          "description": "arXiv:2407.17820v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This monograph elucidates and extends many theorems and conjectures in analytic number theory and algebraic asymptotic analysis via the natural notions of degree and logexponential degree. The Riemann hypothesis, for example, is equivalent to the statement that the degree of the function $\\pi(x)- \\operatorname{li}(x)$ is $1/2$, where $\\pi(x)$ is the prime counting function and $\\operatorname{li}(x)$ is the logarithmic integral function. Part 1 of the text is a survey of analytic number theory, Part 2 introduces the notion of logexponential degree and uses it to extend results in algebraic asymptotic analysis, and Part 3 applies the results of Part 2 to the various functions that figure most prominently in analytic number theory.\n  Central to the notion of logexponential degree are Hardy's logarithmico-exponential functions, which are real functions defined in a neighborhood of $\\infty$ that can be built from $\\operatorname{id}$, $\\exp$, and $\\log$ using the operations $+$, $\\cdot$, $/$, and $\\circ$. Such functions are natural benchmarks for the orders of growth of functions in analytic number theory. The main goal of Part 3 is to express the logexponential degree of various functions in analytic number theory in terms of as few \"logexponential primitives\" as possible. The logexponential degree of the function $e^\\gamma \\prod_{p\\leq x}(1-1/p) -1/\\log x$, for example, can be expressed in terms of that of $\\pi(x)- \\operatorname{li}(x)$ and vice versa (where $\\gamma \\approx 0.5772$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant), despite the fact that very little is known about the logexponential degree of either function separately, even on condition of the Riemann hypothesis.",

In this paper, we investigate the existence of a clique of size $\\sqrt{q}$ with a subspace structure in pseudo-Paley graphs of order $q$ from unions of semi-primitive cyclotomic classes.

Some general results were given for this function (in particular, the case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the cases of $k\\in \\{3,n-3\\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well (negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\\in [\\![ 4;n-4]\\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a continuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles, the particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the Frobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small enough (approximately, $3\\le k\\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free.

While numerous results support this conjecture, S. J. Miller observed that for finite conductors, very different behavior can occur for zeros near the central point in elliptic curve $L$-function families. This led to the creation of the excised model of Due\\~{n}ez, Huynh, Keating, Miller, and Snaith, whose predictions for quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve are well fit by the data. The key ingredients are relating the discretization of central values of the $L$-functions to excising matrices based on the value of the characteristic polynomials at 1 and using lower order terms (in statistics such as the one-level density and pair-correlation) to adjust the matrix size. We extended this model for a family of twists of an $L$-function associated to a given holomorphic cuspidal newform of odd prime level and arbitrary weight. We derive the corresponding \"effective\" matrix size for a given form by computing the one-level density and pair-correlation statistics for a chosen family of twists, and we show there is no repulsion for forms with weight greater than 2 and principal nebentype. We experimentally verify the accuracy of the model, and as expected, our model recovers the elliptic curve model.",

In this paper, we compute the $\\ell$-adic cohomology of the Zariski closure of any such stratum. These are known as closed Bruhat-Tits strata. We prove that the cohomology groups of odd degree vanish, and those of even degree are explicitely determined as representations of the symplectic group with a Frobenius action. Each closed Bruhat-Tits stratum is linearly stratified by Coxeter varieties attached to smaller symplectic groups. Thanks to results of Lusztig who computed the cohomology of Coxeter varieties for classical groups, we make use of the spectral sequence associated to this stratification and describe explicitely all the terms at infinity. We point out that the closed Bruhat-Tits strata have isolated singularities when the dimension is greater than 1. Our analysis requires discussing the smoothness of the blow-up at the singular points, as well as comparing the ordinary $\\ell$-adic cohomology with intersection cohomology. A by-product of our computations is that these two cohomologies actually coincide, so that surprisingly the presence of singularities does not interfere with the cohomology.",

Our method revolves around the spectral sequence associated to the open cover by the analytical tubes of the closed Bruhat-Tits strata in the special fiber, which were constructed by Vollaard and Wedhorn. The cohomology of these strata, which are isomorphic to generalized Deligne-Lusztig varieties, has been computed in a previous paper. This spectral sequence allows us to prove the semisimplicity of the Frobenius action and the non-admissibility of the cohomology in general. Via $p$-adic uniformization, we relate the cohomology of the Rapoport-Zink space to the cohomology of the supersingular locus of a Shimura variety with no level at $p$. In the case $n=3$ or $4$, we give a complete description of the cohomology of the supersingular locus in terms of automorphic representations.",

Of particular interest is the behavior of $\\Lambda_X'(s)$ and the distribution of its zeros (all of which lie inside or on the unit circle). In this article we present several identities for the moments of $\\Lambda_X'(s)$ averaged over $U(N)$, for $x \\in \\mathbb{C}$ as well as specialized to $|x|=1$. Additionally, we prove, for positive integer $k$, that the polynomial $\\int_{U(N)} |\\Lambda_X(1)|^{2k} dX$ of degree $k^2$ in $N$ divides the polynomial $\\int_{U(N)} |\\Lambda_X'(1)|^{2k} dX$ which is of degree $k^2+2k$ in $N$ and that the ratio, $f(N,k)$, of these moments factors into linear factors modulo $4k-1$ if $4k-1$ is prime. We also discuss the relationship of these moments to a solution of a second order non-linear Painl\\'{e}ve differential equation.

This rate is known as the discrepancy of a normal number. The Champernowne constant $c_{10} = 0.12345678910111213141516\\ldots$ is the most well-known example of a normal number.

Consequently, this gives rise to a collection of morphisms of graded spherical Hecke algebras $$\\displaystyle{\\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\textrm{Ext}_{G}^{i}\\left(\\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\\lambda)),~\\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\\lambda))\\right) \\longrightarrow \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\textrm{Ext}_{T}^{i}\\left(\\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\\lambda))),~\\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\\lambda)))\\right)}$$ indexed by $n=-[F:\\mathbb{Q}_p]\\dim(\\mathbf{U}), \\ldots, 0$, which we refer to as derived Satake morphisms. For $\\lambda=0$ and $n=0$, this recovers the graded mod $p$ Satake homomorphism constructed by Ronchetti.\n  We also give some partial results for general standard parabolic subgroups $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{N} \\subset \\mathbf{G}$.",

In 2024, Deng gave the definition to the concept of the dual lattice of a $p$-adic lattice from the duality theory of locally compact abelian groups. He also proved some important properties of the dual lattice of $p$-adic lattices, which can be viewed as $p$-adic analogues of the famous Minkowski's first, second theorems and transference theorems for Euclidean lattices. However, he only proved the lower bounds of the transference theorems and Minkowski's second theorem for $p$-adic lattices. The upper bounds are left as an open question. In this paper, we prove the upper bounds of the transference theorems and Minkowski's second theorem for $p$-adic lattices. We then prove that the dual basis of an orthogonal basis is also an orthogonal basis with respect to the maximum norm.",

This extends the main result of [15] (Invent. Math. 2023), where we assumed that $M$ is odd. We also improve parts of the argument from [15].\n  We have split the earlier (70-page) version into two papers. The current version (49 pages) is the first of the two. The main result is the same as in the previous version: we prove (T2) in the 3-prime even case. The second paper will be posted shortly as a new submission.

This conjectural characterization is inspired by and generalizes the Relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture for families of abelian varieties, recently proved by Gao and Habegger, and it includes as special cases the Manin-Mumford Conjecture (theorem of Raynaud) and the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture (posed by Ghioca, Tucker, and Zhang).

In this paper, we initiate the study of sharp restriction theory on finite fields. We prove that constant functions maximize the Fourier extension inequality from the parabola $\\mathbb{P}^1\\subset \\mathbb{F}^{2\\ast}_q$ and the paraboloid $\\mathbb{P}^2\\subset \\mathbb{F}_q^{3\\ast}$ at the euclidean Stein-Tomas endpoint; here, $\\mathbb{F}_q^{d\\ast}$ denotes the (dual) $d$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\\mathbb F_q$ with $q=p^n$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number greater than $3$ or $2$, respectively. We fully characterize the maximizers for the $L^2\\to L^4$ extension inequality from $\\mathbb{P}^2$ whenever $q\\equiv 1(\\text{mod}\\, 4)$. Our methods lead to analogous results on the hyperbolic paraboloid, whose corresponding euclidean problem remains open. We further establish that constants maximize the $L^2\\to L^4$ extension inequality from the cone $\\Gamma^3:=\\{(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},\\tau, \\sigma)\\in \\mathbb{F}^{4\\ast}_q: \\tau\\sigma=\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^2\\}\\setminus \\{{\\bf 0}\\}$ whenever $q\\equiv 3(\\text{mod}\\, 4)$.

For $4 \\leq d \\leq 90$, we show the number of known equivalence classes of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs in dimension $d$ equals the cardinality of the ideal class monoid of (not necessarily invertible) ideal classes in the real quadratic order of discriminant $(d+1)(d-3)$. Equivalently, this is the number of $\\mathbf{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ conjugacy classes in $\\mathbf{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ of trace $d-1$. We conjecture the equality extends to all $d \\geq 4$. We prove that this conjecture implies more that one equivalence class of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs for every $d > 22$.\n  Additionally, we refine the \"class field hypothesis\" of Appleby, Flammia, McConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field generated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SIC. The class fields conjecturally associated to SICs in dimension $d$ come with a natural partial order under inclusion; we show that the natural inclusions of these fields are strict, except in a small family of cases.",

Moreover, he determined all the instances of $x^my^n\\in \\mathbb Q^\\times$, where $x,y$ are distinct singular moduli and $m,n$ non-zero integers. In this article we obtain a similar result for $k=3$.

In the paper, with an arbitrary bidirected graph we associate a non-negative integral quadratic form (called the incidence form of the graph), and determine all forms that appear in this way in two main results: first, among non-negative connected unit forms, precisely those of Dynkin type $\\mathbb{A}$ or $\\mathbb{D}$ are incidence forms; second, we give simple conditions on the coefficients of a non-negative connected non-unitary form to be an incidence form. We say that those non-unitary forms have Dynkin type $\\mathbb{C}$, and justify such nomenclature by generalizing known classifications and properties of non-negative quadratic forms of Dynkin types $\\mathbb{A}$ and $\\mathbb{D}$ to the introduced type~$\\mathbb{C}$. We also show that the graphical framework of an incidence form is an useful tool to visualize its arithmetical properties, to prove new facts and to perform efficient computations for integral quadratic forms and related problems in number theory, algebra and graph theory. For instance, in a third main result we relate the walks of a bidirected graph with the $0,1,2$-roots of the associated incidence form (and to the classical root systems in the positive case). Moreover, we prove the universality property for a large class of integral quadratic forms, provide computational methods to find solutions or to characterize the finiteness of the sets of solutions of various related Diophantine equations, show a variant of Whitney's theorem on line graphs using switching classes, and apply our techniques to give a conceptual and constructive proof of the non-negativity (and possible Dynkin types) of the Euler quadratic forms of a class of finite-dimensional gentle algebras.",

For arithmetic applications it is often desirable to have the finer control provided by these cocycles readily at hand.

And still we have the possibility to get a better result improving $\\psi_0(x)$.\n  This is a preliminary version, and we set it as a challenge: to compute and study this integral.",

The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition.

We show that the number of spanning trees for the finite intermediate graphs of such a cover can be expressed in terms of the Pierce-Lehmer sequence associated to a factor of the Ihara polynomial. This allows us to express the asymptotic growth of the number of spanning trees in terms of the Mahler measure of this polynomial. Specializing to the situation where the base graph is a bouquet or the dumbbell graph gives us back previous results in the literature for circulant and $I$-graphs (including the generalized Petersen graphs). We also express the $p$-adic valuation of the number of spanning trees of the finite intermediate graphs in terms of the $p$-adic Mahler measure of the Ihara polynomial. When applied to a particular $\\mathbb{Z}$-cover, our result gives us back Lengyel's calculation of the $p$-adic valuations of Fibonacci numbers.",

          "description": "arXiv:2407.03660v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Ramanujan's famous formula for $\\zeta(2m+1)$ has captivated the attention of numerous mathematicians over the years. Grosswald, in 1972, found a simple extension of Ramanujan's formula which in turn gives transformation formula for Eisenstein series over the full modular group. Recently, Banerjee, Gupta and Kumar found a number field analogue of Ramanujan's formula. In this paper, we present a new number field analogue of the Ramanujan-Grosswald formula for $\\zeta(2m+1)$ by obtaining a formula for Dedekind zeta function at odd arguments. We also obtain a number field analogue of an identity of Chandrasekharan and Narasimhan, which played a crucial role in proving our main identity. As an application, we generalize transformation formula for Eisenstein series $G_{2k}(z)$ and Dedekind eta function $\\eta(z)$. A new formula for the class number of a totally real number field is also obtained, which provides a connection with the Kronceker's limit formula for the Dedekind zeta function.",

In this exposition of finite fields and higher reciprocity, we will begin by introducing concepts in abstract algebra and elementary number theory. This will motivate our approach toward understanding the structure and then existence of finite fields, especially with a focus on understanding the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}^{*}$. While surveying finite fields we will provide another proof of quadratic reciprocity. We will proceed to investigate properties of the general multiplicative character, covering the concept of a general Gauss sum as well as basic notions of the Jacobi sum. From there we will begin laying the foundations for the cubic reciprocity law, beginning with a classification of the primes and units of the Eisenstein integers, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$, and further investigations into the residue class ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ for $\\pi$ prime, which is predominantly the world in which cubic reciprocity lies. We then define the general multiplicative character and state the full law of cubic reciprocity. We will finish the section on cubic reciprocity with a brief survey of the cubic residue character of the even prime $2$ and state a significant result due to Gauss that summarizes the conditions for $2$ to be a cubic residue. We conclude with a brief survey of the law of biquadratic reciprocity.",

In fact, we prove a stronger Bogomolov-type result valid for families of split maps in the spirit of the relative Bogomolov conjecture. We thus provide first instances of a generalization of a conjecture by Baker and DeMarco to higher dimensions. Our proof contains both arithmetic and analytic ingredients. We establish a characterization of curves that are preperiodic under the action of a non-exceptional split rational endomorphism $(f,g)$ of $(\\mathbb{P}^1_{\\mathbb{C}})^2$ with respect to the measures of maximal entropy of $f$ and $g$, extending a previous result of Levin-Przytycki. We further establish a height inequality for families of split maps and varieties comparing the values of a fiber-wise Call-Silverman canonical height with a height on the base and valid for most points of a non-preperiodic variety. This provides a dynamical generalization of a result by Habegger and generalizes results of Call-Silverman and Baker to higher dimensions. In particular, we establish a geometric Bogomolov theorem for split rational maps and varieties of arbitrary dimension.",

These probabilistic and geometric points of view lead to a simpler proof. A key idea in the original proof and ours is to consider cyclic shifts of score sequences. We observe, however, that this idea is already present in Kleitman's remarks added to one of Moser's final articles in 1968, and in subsequent works by Kleitman. In the same article, Moser conjectured that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{5/2}$ many score sequences of length $n$.

Our main technique involves exploring higher moment formulas for the primitive Siegel transform. We first demonstrate that if the volume of $S_d$ remains fixed for all $d\\in \\mathbb N$, then the distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Poisson distribution of mean $\\frac 1 2$. Furthermore, if the volume of $S_d$ goes to infinity subexponentially as $d$ approaches infinity, the normalized distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Normal distribution $\\mathcal N(0,1)$. We also extend these results to the setting of stochastic processes.
