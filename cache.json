In this paper, we present the $z$-Minimality Criterion for dense subgroups with some applications to topological matrix groups. For a locally compact group $G$, let $\\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ be the group of all inner automorphisms of $G,$ endowed with the Birkhoff topology. Using a theorem by Goto [14], we obtain our main result which asserts that if $G$ is a connected Lie group and $H\\in\\{G/Z(G), \\operatorname{Inn}(G)\\},$ then $H$ is minimal if and only if it is centre-free and topologically isomorphic to $\\operatorname{Inn}(G/Z(G)).$ In particular, if $G$ is a connected Lie group with discrete centre, then $\\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ is minimal. We prove that a connected locally compact nilpotent group is $z$-minimal if and only if it is compact abelian. In contrast, we show that there exists a connected metabelian $z$-minimal Lie group that is neither compact nor abelian.",

In fact, we determine explicit formulas in the cases when $K_1/\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is totally ramified and when it is unramified. This builds upon the tamely ramified case, which is a classical consequence of Serre's Mass Formula, exhibiting a more restrictive behavior than in the tamely ramified case because the degrees of such extensions are bounded. As a consequence of the calculation, it is also found that the count depends only on the extension $k/k_1$ of residue fields.",

In our previous paper, we investigated the compactifications of the Gaussian Deligne-Mostow variety. Here we work on the remaining case, namely the ring of Eisenstein integers, which is related to the moduli space of unordered 12 points on $\\mathbb P^1$. In particular, we show that Kirwan's partial resolution of the moduli space is not a semi-toroidal compactification and Deligne-Mostow's period map does not lift to the unique toroidal compactification. We give two interpretations of these phenomena in terms of the log minimal model program and automorphic forms. As an application, we prove that the above two compactifications are not (stacky) derived equivalent, as the $DK$-conjecture predicts. Furthermore, we construct an automorphic form on the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 4, which is isogenous to the Eisenstein Deligne-Mostow variety, giving another intrinsic proof, independent of lattice embeddings, of a result by Casalaina-Martin, Jensen and Laza.",

We introduce a canonical height of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) which is finite precisely when the complexifications of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) are K-semistable.

Moreover, it may be expressed as a limit of periods on the N-fold products of the complexifications of X, as N tends to infinity. In particular, using this limit formula, the canonical height for the arithmetic log surfaces (P_1,D) over the integers, where D has at most three components, is computed explicitly in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function and its derivative at s=-1. Combining this explicit formula with previous height formulas for quaternionic Shimura curves yields a procedure for extracting information about the canonical integral models of some Shimura curves, such as wild ramification. Furthermore, explicit formulas for the canonical height of twisted Fermat curves are obtained, implying explicit Parshin type bounds for the Arakelov metric.",

          "description": "arXiv:2406.19717v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In one of the sheets in Riemann's Nachlass he defines an entire function and connect it with his zeta function. As in many pages in his Nachlass, Riemann is not giving complete proofs. However, I consider that this work is undoubtedly by Riemann. He obtains an $L^\\infty$ function whose Fourier transform vanish at the real values $\\gamma$ with $\\zeta(\\frac12+i\\gamma)=0$. We give proofs of Riemann formulas. This is an integral representation of the zeta function different from the known ones. I believe this is the first time it has been published.",

It has one parameter $\\omega$ satisfying $0<\\omega<2$ and recovers MZV in the limit as $\\omega \\to +0$. It is defined in the same algebraic framework as a $q$-analogue of multiple zeta value ($q$MZV) by using a multiple integral. We prove that our deformed multiple zeta value satisfies the double shuffle relations which are satisfied by $q$MZVs. We also prove the extended double Ohno relations, which are proved for ($q$)MZVs by Hirose, Sato and Seki, by using a multiple integral whose integrand contains the hyperbolic gamma function due to Ruijsenaars.",
