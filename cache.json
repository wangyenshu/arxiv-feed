In this paper, we initiate the study of sharp restriction theory on finite fields. We prove that constant functions maximize the Fourier extension inequality from the parabola $\\mathbb{P}^1\\subset \\mathbb{F}^{2\\ast}_q$ and the paraboloid $\\mathbb{P}^2\\subset \\mathbb{F}_q^{3\\ast}$ at the euclidean Stein-Tomas endpoint; here, $\\mathbb{F}_q^{d\\ast}$ denotes the (dual) $d$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\\mathbb F_q$ with $q=p^n$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number greater than $3$ or $2$, respectively. We fully characterize the maximizers for the $L^2\\to L^4$ extension inequality from $\\mathbb{P}^2$ whenever $q\\equiv 1(\\text{mod}\\, 4)$. Our methods lead to analogous results on the hyperbolic paraboloid, whose corresponding euclidean problem remains open. We further establish that constants maximize the $L^2\\to L^4$ extension inequality from the cone $\\Gamma^3:=\\{(\\boldsymbol{\\xi},\\tau, \\sigma)\\in \\mathbb{F}^{4\\ast}_q: \\tau\\sigma=\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^2\\}\\setminus \\{{\\bf 0}\\}$ whenever $q\\equiv 3(\\text{mod}\\, 4)$. By contrast, we prove that constant functions fail to be critical points for the corresponding inequality on $\\Gamma^3\\cup \\{{\\bf 0}\\}$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p^4$. While some inspiration is drawn from the euclidean setting, entirely new phenomena emerge which are related to the underlying arithmetic and discrete structures.",

In this paper, we discuss a combinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this structure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn matrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show that these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric interpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov numbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical Markov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint.

Given a Galois extension of the ground field one can consider similar sets over the extension and take Galois invariants. In this paper, we study under which circumstances the Galois invariants recover the obstruction sets over the ground field. As an application of our results, we study finite abelian descent and Brauer-Manin obstructions for isotrivial curves over function fields and extend results obtained by the first and last authors for constant curves to the isotrivial case.",

The generating function for the analogous rank parity function is $f(q)$, the first example of a mock theta function that Ramanujan mentioned in his last letter to Hardy. Recently we proved congruences modulo powers of $5$ for the rank parity function, and here we extend these congruences for powers of $7$. We also show how these congruences imply congruences modulo powers of $5$ and $7$ for the coefficients of the related third order mock theta function $\\omega(q)$, using Atkin-Lehner involutions and transformation results of Zwegers.

In particular, for certain length three and four hypergeometric data we give an explicit method for finding a modular form $f$ such that the corresponding hypergeometric Galois representation has a subrepresentation isomorphic to the Deligne representation of $f$. Our method utilizes Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions to alternative bases, commutative formal group laws, and supercongruences.

In the paper, with an arbitrary bidirected graph we associate a non-negative integral quadratic form (called the incidence form of the graph), and determine all forms that appear in this way in two main results: first, among non-negative connected unit forms, precisely those of Dynkin type $\\mathbb{A}$ or $\\mathbb{D}$ are incidence forms; second, we give simple conditions on the coefficients of a non-negative connected non-unitary form to be an incidence form. We say that those non-unitary forms have Dynkin type $\\mathbb{C}$, and justify such nomenclature by generalizing known classifications and properties of non-negative quadratic forms of Dynkin types $\\mathbb{A}$ and $\\mathbb{D}$ to the introduced type~$\\mathbb{C}$. We also show that the graphical framework of an incidence form is an useful tool to visualize its arithmetical properties, to prove new facts and to perform efficient computations for integral quadratic forms and related problems in number theory, algebra and graph theory. For instance, in a third main result we relate the walks of a bidirected graph with the $0,1,2$-roots of the associated incidence form (and to the classical root systems in the positive case). Moreover, we prove the universality property for a large class of integral quadratic forms, provide computational methods to find solutions or to characterize the finiteness of the sets of solutions of various related Diophantine equations, show a variant of Whitney's theorem on line graphs using switching classes, and apply our techniques to give a conceptual and constructive proof of the non-negativity (and possible Dynkin types) of the Euler quadratic forms of a class of finite-dimensional gentle algebras.",

We relate this expectation to the arithmetic of the curve $C_K$ over the global function field $K = F(D)$. Specifically, we show that there is a bijection between the set of conjugacy classes of well-behaved morphism of fundamental groups and locally constant adelic points of $C_K$ that survive \\'etale descent.

However, the gerbes so constructed are only canonical up to conjugation by their bands. This is enough in order to ensure that the cohomology set B(G) is canonical, but not enough data to pin down the set of algebraic cocycles used to compute the set B(G). For arithmetic applications it is often desirable to have the finer control provided by these cocycles readily at hand.

For example, let $\\Theta_{6}(q):=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\chi_6(n) n q^{\\frac{n^2-1}{24}}$ be the theta function corresponding to the odd quadratic character modulo $6$. Then for any positive integer $n$, we have $$\\frac{1}{\\Theta_{6}(q)}= q^{-\\frac{3n^2+n}{2}}\\sum_{\\substack{k=r_1\\\\ k\\equiv n\\hspace{-0.2cm}\\pmod{2}}}^{r_2}(-1)^{\\frac{n-k}{2}}A_{k}(q)C_{\\frac{3n-k}{2}}(q)+O(q^{n+1}),$$ where $r_1:=\\lfloor\\frac{3n-1-\\sqrt{12n+13}}{3}\\rfloor+1$ and $r_2:=\\lceil\\frac{3n-1+\\sqrt{12n+13}}{3}\\rceil-1$.",

The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.",

We also obtain a number field analogue of an identity of Chandrasekharan and Narasimhan, which played a crucial role in proving our main identity. As an application, we generalize transformation formula for Eisenstein series $G_{2k}(z)$ and Dedekind eta function $\\eta(z)$.

In this exposition of finite fields and higher reciprocity, we will begin by introducing concepts in abstract algebra and elementary number theory. This will motivate our approach toward understanding the structure and then existence of finite fields, especially with a focus on understanding the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}^{*}$. While surveying finite fields we will provide another proof of quadratic reciprocity. We will proceed to investigate properties of the general multiplicative character, covering the concept of a general Gauss sum as well as basic notions of the Jacobi sum. From there we will begin laying the foundations for the cubic reciprocity law, beginning with a classification of the primes and units of the Eisenstein integers, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$, and further investigations into the residue class ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ for $\\pi$ prime, which is predominantly the world in which cubic reciprocity lies. We then define the general multiplicative character and state the full law of cubic reciprocity.

We define a multiplicative $B_{h}^{\\times}[g]$ set analogously. In this paper, we prove, amongst other results, that there exist absolute constants $g \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\delta>0$ such that for any $h \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and for any finite set $A$ of integers, the largest $B_{h}^{+}[g]$ set $B$ inside $A$ and the largest $B_{h}^{\\times}[g]$ set $C$ inside $A$ satisfy \\[ \\max \\{ |B| , |C| \\} \\gg_{h} |A|^{(1+ \\delta)/h }. \\] In fact, when $h=2$, we may set $g = 31$, and when $h$ is sufficiently large, we may set $g = 1$ and $\\delta \\gg (\\log \\log h)^{1/2 - o(1)}$.

These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms.

We compute several interesting arithmetic invariants of $J_m$: its decomposition up to isogeny into simple abelian varieties, the minimal field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\operatorname{End}(J_m))$ over which its endomorphisms are defined, its connected monodromy field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\varepsilon_{J_m})$, and its Sato-Tate group. Currently, there is no general algorithm that computes these last two invariants. Furthermore, for large enough values of $m$, the abelian varieties $J_m$ provide non-trivial examples of high-dimensional phenomena, such as degeneracy and the non-triviality of the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\varepsilon_{J_m})/\\mathbb{Q}(\\operatorname{End}(J_m))$. We also describe the Sato-Tate group of an abelian variety, generalizing existing results that apply only to non-degenerate varieties, and prove an extension of a well-known formula of Gross-Koblitz that relates values of the classical and $p$-adic gamma functions at rational arguments.",

We show that this connection is, in fact, an instance of the L\\'evy-Khintchine formula from probability theory, and highlight how such formulas can be useful in enumerative combinatorics. Our proof combines renewal theory with the representation of score sequences as lattice paths, due to Erd\\H{o}s and Moser in the 1960s. These probabilistic and geometric points of view lead to a simpler proof. A key idea in the original proof and ours is to consider cyclic shifts of score sequences. We observe, however, that this idea is already present in Kleitman's remarks added to one of Moser's final articles in 1968, and in subsequent works by Kleitman. In the same article, Moser conjectured that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{5/2}$ many score sequences of length $n$.

In our previous paper, we investigated the compactifications of the Gaussian Deligne-Mostow variety. Here we work on the remaining case, namely the ring of Eisenstein integers, which is related to the moduli space of unordered 12 points on $\\mathbb P^1$. In particular, we show that Kirwan's partial resolution of the moduli space is not a semi-toroidal compactification and Deligne-Mostow's period map does not lift to the unique toroidal compactification. We give two interpretations of these phenomena in terms of the log minimal model program and automorphic forms. As an application, we prove that the above two compactifications are not (stacky) derived equivalent, as the $DK$-conjecture predicts. Furthermore, we construct an automorphic form on the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 4, which is isogenous to the Eisenstein Deligne-Mostow variety, giving another intrinsic proof, independent of lattice embeddings, of a result by Casalaina-Martin, Jensen and Laza.",

It behaves as a Siegel modular form with respect to the first variable, and is a closed differential form on an orthogonal Shimura variety with respect to the other variable. We prove that the Lefschetz decomposition of the cohomology class of that theta function is also its modular decomposition in Eisenstein, Klingen and cuspidal parts. We also show that the image of the Kudla-Millson lift is contained in the primitive cohomology of X. As an application, we deduce dimension formulas for the cohomology of X in low degree. Our results cover the cases of moduli spaces of compact hyperk\\\"ahler manifolds.",

For any lacunary sequence $(a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ we prove the existence of a dilation factor $\\alpha$ such that the maximal gap is of order at most $(\\log N)/N$, and we prove that for Lebesgue almost all $\\alpha$ the maximal gap is of order at most $(\\log N)^{2+\\varepsilon}/N$. The metric result is generalized to other measures satisfying a certain Fourier decay assumption. Both upper bounds are optimal up to a factor of logarithmic order, and the latter result improves a recent result of Chow and Technau.

We introduce a canonical height of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) which is finite precisely when the complexifications of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) are K-semistable. When the complexifications are K-polystable, the canonical height is the height of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) wrt any volume-normalized K\\\"ahler-Einstein metric on the complexifications of K_(X,D) (and -K(X,D)) The canonical height is shown to have a number of useful variational properties. Moreover, it may be expressed as a limit of periods on the N-fold products of the complexifications of X, as N tends to infinity. In particular, using this limit formula, the canonical height for the arithmetic log surfaces (P_1,D) over the integers, where D has at most three components, is computed explicitly in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function and its derivative at s=-1. Combining this explicit formula with previous height formulas for quaternionic Shimura curves yields a procedure for extracting information about the canonical integral models of some Shimura curves, such as wild ramification. Furthermore, explicit formulas for the canonical height of twisted Fermat curves are obtained, implying explicit Parshin type bounds for the Arakelov metric.",
